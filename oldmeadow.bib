  abstract   = {This study reports carer strain and coping with medications for people with dementia with an unplanned admission to hospital, and it evaluates the impact of a safe medication intervention on carer coping and carer strain. This was a quasi-experimental pre/post-controlled trial that included a survey of carers about managing medications for people with dementia after discharge. For 88 carers who completed surveys, 33\% were concerned about managing medications, and 40\% reported difficulties with medication management, including resistive behaviours by people with dementia. Dose administration aids were used by 72\% of carers; however, only 15\% reported receiving a recent home medicines review by a community pharmacist. High carer strain was reported by 74\% of carers. Carer comments described many issues that contributed to high carer stress, as well as their engagement in vigilant activities to maintain medication safety. Strategies that can contribute to carers managing medications and reducing their strain include an increased use of dose administration aids, increased provision of home medicines reviews, and increased education of health professionals to provide adequate support and education about managing medications.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: 'Physical Activity 4 Everyone' (PA4E1) was an efficacious multi-component school-based physical activity (PA) program targeting adolescents. PA4E1 has seven PA practices. It is essential to scale-up, evaluate effectiveness and assess implementation of such programs. Therefore, the aim is to assess the impact of implementation support on school practice uptake of the PA4E1 program at 12 and 24 months.
METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial, utilising a type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness design, was conducted in 49 randomly selected disadvantaged Australian Government and Catholic secondary schools. A blinded statistician randomly allocated schools to a usual practice control (n = 25) or the PA4E1 program group (n = 24), with the latter receiving seven implementation support strategies to support school PA practice uptake of the seven practices retained from the efficacy trial. The primary outcome was the proportion of schools adopting at least four of the seven practices, assessed via telephone surveys with Head Physical Education Teachers and analysed using exact logistic regression modelling. This paper reports the 12-month outcomes.
RESULTS: Schools were recruited from May to November 2017. At baseline, no schools implemented four of the seven practices. At 12 months significantly more schools in the program group had implemented four of the seven practices (16/24, 66.7\%) than the control group (1/25, 4\%) (OR = 33.0[4.15-1556.4], p {\textless} 0.001). The program group implemented on average 3.2 (2.5-3.9) more practices than the control group (p {\textless} 0.001, mean 3.9 (SD 1.5) vs 0.7 (1.0)). Fidelity and reach of the implementation support intervention were high (both {\textgreater} 80\%).
CONCLUSIONS: Through the application of multiple implementation support strategies, secondary schools were able to overcome commonly known barriers to implement evidence based school PA practices. As such practices have been shown to result in an increase in adolescent PA and improvements in weight status, policy makers and practitioners responsible for advocating PA in schools should consider this implementation approach more broadly when working with schools. Follow-up is required to determine whether practice implementation is sustained.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Transfer of residential aged-care facility (RACF) residents to Emergency Departments (ED) is common, risky and expensive. RACF residents who present to ED are more likely to have hospital readmissions, longer stays and face major risks related to hospital acquired complications. Aged Care Emergency services (ACE) is a nurse led, protocol- guided, telephone RACF/ED outreach model that has been shown to be effective in reducing hospitalisation and length of hospital stay for RACF residents in the Hunter New England Local Health District, New South Wales (NSW). The Partnerships in Aged-Care Emergency services using Interactive Telehealth (PACE-IT) project enhances ACE by incorporating interactive video assessment and consultation. The PACE-IT project's primary aim is to assess whether augmentation of ACE services through the addition of protocol-guided interactive Visual Telehealth Consultation (VTC) for clinical decision-making, plus telephone follow-up, reduces RACF resident transfers to ED.
METHODS: A stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted. The intervention will be delivered sequentially to 8 clusters; each cluster comprises one ED and two RACFs in NSW, Australia. The 16 RACFs in the study will be selected for order of implementation using a computer-generated randomisation sequence. A 2-step randomisation process will be undertaken, randomising the hospital EDs first and then randomising the RACFs aligned with each hospital. The PACE-IT intervention comprises: an initial phone call by RACFs to the ACE service in the ED; the ACE service in ED responds with a protocol-guided VTC, a management plan agreed between all participants; an automated consultation summary letter to the General Practitioner and the RACF; a post VTC 24 h follow-up phone call to the RACF.
DISCUSSION: If shown to be effective, the intervention has the potential to improve the clinical care and quality of life for residents. Findings will provide high level evidence that will inform sustainable change and broad translation into practice across NSW. It will show how the change has been achieved and highlight success factors for scalability and sustainability. It will inform review of processes, the development of policy and guidelines that will integrate PACE-IT into existing service models in NSW.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Despite the importance and popularity of mutual support groups, there have been no systematic attempts to implement and evaluate routine outcome monitoring (ROM) in these settings. Unlike other mutual support groups for addiction, trained facilitators lead all Self-Management and Recovery Training (SMART Recovery) groups, thereby providing an opportunity to implement ROM as a routine component of SMART Recovery groups.
OBJECTIVE: This study protocol aims to describe a stage 1 pilot study designed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, purpose-built mobile health (mHealth) ROM and feedback app (Smart Track) in SMART Recovery groups coordinated by SMART Recovery Australia (SRAU) The secondary objectives are to describe Smart Track usage patterns, explore psychometric properties of the ROM items (ie, internal reliability and convergent and divergent validity), and provide preliminary evidence for participant reported outcomes (such as alcohol and other drug use, self-reported recovery, and mental health).
METHODS: Participants (n=100) from the SMART Recovery groups across New South Wales, Australia, will be recruited to a nonrandomized, prospective, single-arm trial of the Smart Track app. There are 4 modes of data collection: (1) ROM data collected from group participants via the Smart Track app, (2) data analytics summarizing user interactions with Smart Track, (3) quantitative interview and survey data of group participants (baseline, 2-week follow-up, and 2-month follow-up), and (4) qualitative interviews with group participants (n=20) and facilitators (n=10). Feasibility and acceptability (primary objectives) will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, a cost analysis, and a qualitative evaluation.
RESULTS: At the time of submission, 13 sites (25 groups per week) had agreed to be involved. Funding was awarded on August 14, 2017, and ethics approval was granted on April 26, 2018 (HREC/18/WGONG/34; 2018/099). Enrollment is due to commence in July 2019. Data collection is due to be finalized in October 2019.
CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use ROM and tailored feedback within a mutual support group setting for addictive behaviors. Our study design will provide an opportunity to identify the acceptability of a novel mHealth ROM and feedback app within this setting and provide detailed information on what factors promote or hinder ROM usage within this context. This project aims to offer a new tool, should Smart Track prove feasible and acceptable, that service providers, policy makers, and researchers could use in the future to understand the impact of SMART Recovery groups.

  abstract   = {INTRODUCTION: Quantifying Home Cooking EnviRonments has applications in nutrition epidemiology, health promotion, and nutrition interventions. This study aimed to develop a tool to quantify household cooking environments and establish its content validity, face validity, and inter-rater agreement.
METHODS: The Home Cooking EnviRonment and equipment Inventory observation form (Home-CookERI™) was developed as a 24-question (91-item) online survey. Items included domestic spaces and resources for storage, disposal, preparation, and cooking of food or non-alcoholic beverages. Home-CookERITM was piloted to assess content validity, face validity, and usability with six Australian experts (i.e., dietitians, nutrition researchers, chefs, a food technology teacher, and a kitchen designer) and 13 laypersons. Pilot participants provided feedback in a 10 min telephone interview. Home-CookERI™ was modified to an 89-item survey in line with the pilot findings. Inter-rater agreement was examined between two trained raters in 33 unique Australian households. Raters were required to observe each item before recording a response. Home occupants were instructed to only assist with locating items if asked. Raters were blinded to each other's responses. Inter-rater agreement was calculated by Cohen's Kappa coefficient (κ) for each item. To optimize κ, similar items were grouped together reducing the number of items to 81.
RESULTS: Home-CookERITM had excellent content and face validity with responding participants; all 24 questions were both clear and relevant (X2 (1, n = 19; 19.0, p = 0.392)). Inter-rater agreement for the modified 81-item Home-CookERI™ was almost-perfect to perfect for 46\% of kitchen items (n = 37 items, κ = 0.81-1), moderate to substantial for 28\% (n = 23, κ = 0.51-0.8), slight to fair for 15\% (n = 12, κ = 0.01-0.5), and chance or worse for 11\% of items (n = 9, κ ≤ 0.0). Home-CookERITM was further optimized by reduction to a 77-item version, which is now available to researchers.
CONCLUSION: Home-CookERI™ is a comprehensive tool for quantifying Australian household cooking environments. It has excellent face and content validity and moderate to perfect inter-rater agreement for almost three-quarters of included kitchen items. To expand Home-CookERI™ applications, a home occupant self-completion version is planned for validation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Severe asthma with fungal sensitization (SAFS) and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) are important complications of severe asthma. The evidence for treating them with omalizumab is limited.
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of treatment with omalizumab in patients with severe allergic asthma comparing those with and without evidence of fungal sensitization using data recorded in the Australian Xolair Registry.
METHODS: Data from 205 patients who received omalizumab and recorded in the Australian Xolair Registry were analyzed to determine change in the Juniper 5-item Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ-5) score, exacerbation frequency, and oral corticosteroid dose over a 24-month period of omalizumab treatment. Patients were grouped into cohorts on the basis of fungal sensitization, and an analysis of improvement in outcomes between baseline and 24 months was conducted within each group. A further subgroup analysis of patients with ABPA was also conducted.
RESULTS: Patients with SAFS (n = 62), including those with ABPA (ASAFS), were as likely to demonstrate significant improvements in ACQ-5 score and exacerbations and reduced regular oral corticosteroid dose over 24 months as those with severe asthma without sensitization to fungi (n = 156). After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking history, and baseline FEV1\%, the effects still remained. A subgroup analysis of 11 patients with ABPA similarly demonstrated a significant improvement on omalizumab.
CONCLUSIONS: Omalizumab is an effective therapy in ASAFS, leading to sustained improvements in symptoms and exacerbations for 24 months. The benefit for ABPA is less clear because of the small sample size.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Medication errors are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Clinical pharmacy services provided in hospital can reduce medication errors and medication related harm. However, few rural or remote hospitals in Australia have a clinical pharmacy service. This study will evaluate a virtual clinical pharmacy service (VCPS) provided via telehealth to eight rural and remote hospitals in NSW, Australia.
METHODS: A stepped wedge cluster randomised trial design will use routinely collected data from patients' electronic medical records (n = 2080) to evaluate the VCPS at eight facilities. The sequence of steps is randomised, allowing for control of potential confounding temporal trends. Primary outcomes are number of medication reconciliations completed on admission and discharge. Secondary outcomes are length of stay, falls and 28 day readmissions. A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) will be conducted. The CEA will answer the question of whether the VCPS is more cost-effective compared to treatment as usual; the CBA will consider the rate of return on investing in the VCPS. A patient experience measure (n = 500) and medication adherence questionnaire (n = 100 pre and post) will also be used to identify patient responses to the virtual service. Focus groups will investigate implementation from hospital staff perspectives at each site. Analyses of routine data will comprise generalised linear mixed models. Descriptive statistical analysis will summarise patient experience responses. Differences in medication adherence will be compared using linear regression models. Thematic analysis of focus groups will identify barriers and facilitators to VCPS implementation.
DISCUSSION: We aim to demonstrate the effectiveness of virtual pharmacy interventions for rural populations, and inform best practice for using virtual healthcare to improve access to pharmacy services. It is widely recognised that clinical pharmacists are best placed to reduce medication errors. However, pharmacy services are limited in rural and remote hospitals. This project will provide evidence about ways in which the benefits of hospital pharmacists can be maximised utilising telehealth technology. If successful, this project can provide a model for pharmacy delivery in rural and remote locations.

DESIGN: Population-based analytical study.
METHODS: In the Blue Mountains Eye Study, Australia (European ancestry n = 2826) and Multi-Ethnic Cohort Study, Singapore (Asian ancestry, n = 1900), AMD was assessed from retinal photographs. Patterns of dietary composition and scores of the Alternative Healthy Eating Index were computed using food frequency questionnaire data. Genetic susceptibility to AMD was determined using either single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the complement factor H and age-related maculopathy susceptibility 2 genes, or combined odds-weighted genetic risk scores of 24 AMD-associated SNPs. Associations of AMD with ethnicity, diet, and genetics were assessed using logistic regression. Six potential mediators covering genetic, diet and lifestyle factors were assessed for their contributions to AMD risk difference between the two samples using mediation analyses.
RESULTS: Age-standardized prevalence of any (early or late) AMD was higher in the European (16\%) compared to Asian samples (9\%, p {\textless} .01). Mean AMD-related genetic risk scores were also higher in European (33.3 ± 4.4) than Asian (Chinese) samples (31.7 ± 3.7, p {\textless} .001). In a model simultaneously adjusting for age, ethnicity, genetic susceptibility and Alternative Healthy Eating Index scores, only age and genetic susceptibility were significantly associated with AMD. Genetic risk scores contributed 19\% of AMD risk difference between the two samples while intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids contributed 7.2\%.
CONCLUSION: Genetic susceptibility to AMD was higher in European compared to Chinese samples and explained more of the AMD risk difference between the two samples than the dietary factors investigated.},

  abstract = {© 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Purpose: The importance of distress identification and management in oncology has been established. We examined the relationship between distress and unmet bio-psychosocial needs, applying advanced statistical techniques, to identify which needs have the closest relationship to distress. Methods: Oncology outpatients (n = 1066) undergoing QUICATOUCH screening in an Australian cancer centre completed the distress thermometer (DT) and problem list (PL). Principal component analysis (PCA), logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses tested the relationship between DT score (at a cut-off point of 4) and PL items. Results: Sixteen items were reported by {\textless}5 \% of participants. PCA analysis identified four major components. Logistic regression analysis indicated three of these component scores, and four individual items (20 items in total) demonstrated a significant independent relationship with distress. The best CART model contained only two PL items: ‘worry’ and ‘depression’. Conclusions: The DT and PL function as intended, quantifying negative emotional experience (distress) and identifying bio-psychosocial sources of distress. We offer two suggestions to minimise PL response time whilst targeting PL items most related to distress, thereby increasing clinical utility. To identify patients who might require specialised psychological services, we suggest the DT followed by a short, case-finding instrument for patients over threshold on the DT. To identify other important sources of distress, we suggest using a modified PL of 14 key items, with the 15th item ‘any other problem’ as a simple safety net question. Shorter times for patient completion and clinician response to endorsed PL items will maximise acceptance and clinical utility.},

  abstract = {© 2018 The Author(s). Background: Admitted patients with chronic disease are at high risk of an unplanned hospital readmission, however, little research has examined unplanned readmission among Aboriginal people in Australia. This study aimed to examine whether rates of unplanned 28 day hospital readmission, or death, significantly differ between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients in New South Wales, Australia, over a nine-year period. Methods: A retrospective cohort analysis of a sample of de-identified linked hospital administrative data was conducted. Eligible patients were: 1) aged ≥18 years old, 2) admitted to an acute facility in a NSW public hospital between 30th June 2005 and 1st July 2014, and 3) admitted with either cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, diabetes or renal disease. The primary composite outcome was unplanned readmission or death within 28 days of discharge. Generalized linear models and a test for trend were used to assess rates of unplanned readmission or death over time in Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients with chronic disease, accounting for sociodemographic variables. Results: The final study cohort included 122,145 separations corresponding to 48,252 patients (Aboriginal = 57.2\%, n = 27,601; non-Aboriginal = 42.8\%, n = 20,651). 13.9\% (n = 16,999) of all separations experienced an unplanned readmission or death within 28 days of discharge. Death within 28 days of discharge alone accounted for only a small number of separations (1.4\%; n = 1767). Over the nine-year period, Aboriginal separations had a significantly higher relative risk of an unplanned readmission or death (Relative risk = 1.34 (1.29, 1.40); p-value {\textless} 0.0001) compared with non-Aboriginal separations once adjusted for sociodemographic, disease variables and restricted to {\textless} 75 years of age. A test for trend, including an interaction between year and Aboriginal status, showed there was no statistically significant change in proportions over the nine-year period for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal separations (p-value for trend = 0.176). Conclusion: Aboriginal people with chronic disease had a significantly higher risk of unplanned readmission or death 28 days post discharge from hospital compared with non-Aboriginal people, and there has been no significant change over the nine year period. It is critical that effective interventions to reduce unplanned readmissions for Aboriginal people are identified.},

  abstract = {© 2019 Author(s). Introduction Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a non-invasive alternative to surgery for the treatment of non-metastatic prostate cancer (PC). The objectives of the Novel Integration of New prostate radiation schedules with adJuvant Androgen deprivation (NINJA) clinical trial are to compare two emerging SBRT regimens for efficacy with technical substudies focussing on MRI only planning and the use of knowledge-based planning (KBP) to assess radiotherapy plan quality. Methods and analysis Eligible patients must have biopsy-proven unfavourable intermediate or favourable high-risk PC, have an Eastern Collaborative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-1 and provide written informed consent. All patients will receive 6 months in total of androgen deprivation therapy. Patients will be randomised to one of two SBRT regimens. The first will be 40 Gy in five fractions given on alternating days (SBRT monotherapy). The second will be 20 Gy in two fractions given 1 week apart followed 2 weeks later by 36 Gy in 12 fractions given five times per week (virtual high-dose rate boost (HDRB)). The primary efficacy outcome will be biochemical clinical control at 5 years. Secondary endpoints for the initial portion of NINJA look at the transition of centres towards MRI only planning and the impact of KBP on real-time (RT) plan assessment. The first 150 men will demonstrate accrual feasibility as well as addressing the KBP and MRI planning aims, prior to proceeding with total accrual to 472 patients as a phase III randomised controlled trial. Ethics and dissemination NINJA is a multicentre cooperative clinical trial comparing two SBRT regimens for men with PC. It builds on promising results from several single-armed studies, and explores radiation dose escalation in the Virtual HDRB arm. The initial component includes novel technical elements, and will form an important platform set for a definitive phase III study. Trial registration number ANZCTN 12615000223538.},

No studies have examined the validity of the MADRS compared to an established clinical diagnostic tool of depression in this population. This study aimed to examine the following: (i) the validity of the MADRS compared to a clinical diagnosis of a depressive disorder (using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR [SCID-IV-TR]) in patients seeking treatment for alcohol dependence (AD); (ii) whether the validity of the MADRS differs by type of SCID-IV-TR-based diagnosis of depression; and (iii) which items contribute to the optimal predictive model of the MADRS compared to a SCID-IV-TR diagnosis of a depressive disorder. Methods: Individuals seeking treatment for AD and admitted to an inpatient unit were administered the MADRS at day 2 of their detoxification program. Clinical diagnoses of AD and depression were made via the SCID-IV-TR at the beginning of treatment. Results: In total, 803 participants were included in the study. The MADRS demonstrated low overall accuracy relative to the clinical diagnosis of depression with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.68. The optimal threshold for balancing sensitivity and specificity identified by the Euclidean distance was  {\textgreater} 14. This cut-point demonstrated a sensitivity of 66\%, a specificity of 60\%, a positive predictive value of 50\%, and a negative predictive value of 75\%. The MADRS performed slightly better for major depressive disorders compared to alcohol-induced depression. Items related to lassitude, concentration, and appetite slightly decreased the accuracy of the MADRS. Conclusions: The MADRS does not appear to be an appropriate substitute for a diagnostic tool among alcohol-dependent patients. The MADRS may, however, still be a useful screening tool assuming careful consideration of cut-points.},

Context: Depleted nitric oxide levels in the human body play a major role in cardiovascular disease pathogenesis. Inorganic nitrate/nitrite (rich dietary sources include beetroot and spinach) can act as a nitric oxide donor because nitrate/nitrite can be metabolized to produce nitric oxide. Objective: This review and metaanalysis sought to investigate the role of inorganic nitrate/nitrite in preventing or treating cardiovascular disease risk factors in humans. Data Sources: Electronic databases, including Medline, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Cochrane, and Scopus, were searched. Data Extraction: Experimental trials examining the effect of oral inorganic nitrate/nitrite intake on cardiovascular disease risk factors were included for systematic analysis. Results: Thirty-four studies were included for qualitative synthesis, 23 of which were eligible for meta-analysis. Included studies measured the following outcomes: blood pressure, endothelial function, arterial stiffness, platelet aggregation, and/or blood lipids. Inorganic nitrate intake was found to significantly reduce resting blood pressure (systolic blood pressure: -4.80mmHg, P {\textless} 0.0001; diastolic blood pressure: -1.74mmHg, P=0.001), improve endothelial function (flow-mediated dilatation: 0.59\%, P {\textless} 0.0001), reduce arterial stiffness (pulse wave velocity: -0.23 m/s, P {\textless} 0.0001; augmentation index: -2.1\%, P=0.05), and reduce platelet aggregation by 18.9\% (P {\textless} 0.0001). Conclusions: Inorganic nitrate consumption represents a simple strategy for targeting cardiovascular disease risk factors. Future studies investigating the long-term effects of inorganic nitrate on cardiovascular disease outcomes are warranted.},

  abstract = {© 2016 Introduction Few interventions have been successful in reducing the physical activity decline typically observed among adolescents. The aim of this paper is to report the 24-month effectiveness of a multicomponent school-based intervention (Physical Activity 4 Everyone) in reducing the decline in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among secondary school students in disadvantaged areas of New South Wales, Australia. Study design A cluster RCT was conducted in five intervention and five control schools with follow-up measures taken at 24 months post-randomization. Setting/participants The trial was undertaken within secondary schools located in disadvantaged communities in New South Wales, Australia. Intervention A multicomponent school-based intervention based on the Health Promoting Schools Framework was implemented. The intervention consisted of seven physical activity promotion strategies that targeted the curriculum (teaching strategies to increase physical activity in physical education lessons, student physical activity plans, and modification of school sport program); school environment (recess/lunchtime activities, school physical activity policy); parents (parent newsletters); and community (community physical activity provider promotion). Six additional strategies supported school implementation of the physical activity intervention strategies. Main outcome measure Minutes per day spent in MVPA, objectively measured by accelerometer. Results Participants (N=1,150, 49\% male) were a cohort of students aged 12 years (Grade 7) at baseline (March–June 2012) and 14 years (Grade 9) at follow-up (March–July 2014). At 24-month follow-up, there were significant effects in favor of the intervention group for daily minutes of MVPA. The adjusted mean difference in change in daily MVPA between groups was 7.0 minutes (95\% CI=2.7, 11.4, p{\textless}0.002) (analysis conducted December 2014–February 2015). Sensitivity analyses based on multiple imputation were consistent with the main analysis (6.0 minutes, 95\% CI=0.6, 11.3, p{\textless}0.031). Conclusions The intervention was effective in increasing adolescents’ minutes of MVPA, suggesting that implementation of the intervention by disadvantaged schools has the potential to slow the decline in physical activity.

Health professionals report lack of knowledge, skills and confidence to effectively manage smoking among pregnant women in general. We developed a behaviour change intervention aimed to improve health professionals' management of smoking in Indigenous pregnant women - the Indigenous Counselling And Nicotine (ICAN) QUIT in Pregnancy. This intervention includes webinar training for health professionals, an educational resources package for health professionals and pregnant women, free oral nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for pregnant women, and audit and feedback on health professionals' performance. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and acceptability of the ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy intervention to improve health professionals' provision of evidence-based culturally responsive smoking cessation care to Australian Indigenous pregnant smokers. Methods and analysis This protocol describes the design of a step-wedge cluster randomised pilot study. Six Aboriginal Medical Services (AMSs) are randomised into three clusters. Clusters receive the intervention staggered by 1 month. Health professionals report on their knowledge and skills pretraining and post-training and at the end of the study. Pregnant women are recruited and followed up for 3 months. The primary outcome is the recruitment rate of pregnant women. Secondary outcomes include feasibility of recruitment and follow-up of participating women, and webinar training of health professionals, measured using a designated log; and measures of effectiveness outcomes, including quit rates and NRT prescription rates. Ethics and dissemination In accordance with the Aboriginal Health and Medical Research Council guidelines, this study has been developed in collaboration with a Stakeholder and Consumer Aboriginal Advisory Panel (SCAAP). The SCAAP provides cultural consultation, advice and direction to ensure that implementation is acceptable and respectful to the Aboriginal communities involved. Results will be disseminated to AMSs, Aboriginal communities and national Aboriginal bodies.},

Aboriginal people also have higher rates of unplanned hospital readmissions and emergency department presentations. There is a paucity of research on the effectiveness of follow up programs after discharge from hospital in Aboriginal populations. This study aimed to assess the impact of a telephone follow up program, 48 Hour Follow Up, on rates of unplanned hospital readmissions, unplanned emergency department presentations and mortality within 28 days of discharge among Aboriginal people with chronic disease. Methods: A retrospective cohort of eligible Aboriginal people with chronic diseases was obtained through linkage of routinely-collected health datasets for the period May 2009 to December 2014. The primary outcome was unplanned hospital readmissions within 28 days of separation from any acute New South Wales public hospital. Secondary outcomes were mortality, unplanned emergency department presentations, and at least one adverse event (unplanned hospital readmission, unplanned emergency department presentation or mortality) within 28 days of separation. Logistic regression models were used to assess outcomes among Aboriginal patients who received 48 Hour Follow Up compared with eligible Aboriginal patients who did not receive 48 Hour Follow Up. Results: The final study cohort included 18,659 patients with 49,721 separations, of which 8469 separations (17.0, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 16.7-17.4) were recorded as having received 48 Hour Follow Up. After adjusting for potential confounders, there were no significant differences in rates of unplanned readmission or mortality within 28 days between people who received or did not receive 48 Hour Follow Up. Conversely, the odds of an unplanned emergency department presentation (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.92; 95\% CI: 0.85, 0.99; P = 0.0312) and at least one adverse event (OR = 0.91; 95\% CI: 0.85,0.98; P = 0.0136) within 28 days were significantly lower for separations where the patient received 48 Hour Follow Up compared with those that did not receive follow up. Conclusions: Receipt of 48 Hour Follow Up was associated with both a reduction in emergency department presentations and at least one adverse event within 28 days of discharge, suggesting there may be merit in providing post-discharge telephone follow up to Aboriginal people with chronic disease.},

  abstract = {© 2019 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd Background: The burden of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on the Australian health system is growing. Efforts to reverse this trend have not been successful. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of a targeted asynchronous web based e-learning module on general practice nurses’ behavioural intentions in relation to opportunistic screening practices for people at risk of CKD. Design: Double blinded pre-post interventional randomised control design. Methods: Participants were nurses working in general practice settings in Australia. Participants were randomised to a knowledge based active control or targeted behavioural based intervention which were delivered using asynchronous e-learning modules. The intervention was designed to influence the behavioural constructs of the theory of planned behaviour (TPB): attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control (PBC). Results: Of the 420 participants, we analysed the primary and secondary outcomes for 212 (50.47\%) who had complete follow up data. There were no significant differences (p 0.424, [d] 0.04) in behavioural intention between the intervention and control groups at follow-up, when controlling for baseline values. However, regression models assessing the relationship between the change in the TPB constructs and behavioural intention at follow-up for all participants, regardless of study arm, demonstrated a significant change in intention to initiate a kidney health check. Although these changes could not be attributed to the effect of the intervention. Attitude (r2 = 0.3525, p 0.0004) and PBC (r2 = 0.3510, p 0.0005) models accounted for approximately 35\% of the explained variance in behavioural intentions and social norm (r2 = 0.3297, p 0.0171) accounted for approximately 33\% of the variance. When all TPB constructs were included in the model, 37\% of the variance in intention was explained. Conclusion: A targeted behavioural online intervention was no more effective than a knowledge based online program to improve primary health care nurses’ intention to initiate a kidney health check in people at risk of chronic kidney disease. Relevance to clinical practice: Collaborative efforts are required by all staff working in general practice to develop models of care to improve screening practices for chronic kidney disease. Future research should focus on interventions that improve collaboration between health care professionals in the primary care setting and public health campaigns to increase awareness of risks of CKD and the importance of screening in the primary care setting.},

  abstract = {© 2017 American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Objective To examine the effect of universal, school-based, resilience-focused interventions on mental health problems in children and adolescents. Method Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of universal, school-based interventions that included strategies to strengthen a minimum of 3 internal resilience protective factors, and included an outcome measure of mental health problems in children and adolescents aged 5 to 18 years. Six databases were searched from 1995 to 2015. Results were pooled in meta-analyses by mental health outcome (anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, hyperactivity, conduct problems, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and general psychological distress), for all trials (5−18 years). Subgroup analyses were conducted by age (child: 5−10 years; adolescent: 11−18 years), length of follow-up (short: post-≤12 months; long: {\textgreater}12 months), and gender (narrative). Results A total of 57 included trials were identified from 5,984 records, with 49 contributing to meta-analyses. For all trials, resilience-focused interventions were effective relative to a control in reducing 4 of 7 outcomes: depressive symptoms, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, and general psychological distress. For child trials (meta-analyses for 6 outcomes), interventions were effective for anxiety symptoms and general psychological distress. For adolescent trials (meta-analyses for 5 outcomes), interventions were effective for internalizing problems. For short-term follow-up, interventions were effective for 2 of 7 outcomes: depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. For long-term follow-up (meta-analyses for 5 outcomes), interventions were effective for internalizing problems. Conclusion The findings may suggest most promise for using universal resilience-focused interventions at least for short-term reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms for children and adolescents, particularly if a cognitive-behavioral therapy−based approach is used. The limited number of trials providing data amenable for meta-analysis for some outcomes and subgroups, the variability of interventions, study quality, and bias mean that it is not possible to draw more specific conclusions. Identifying what intervention qualities (such as number and type of protective factor) achieve the greatest positive effect per mental health problem outcome remains an important area for future research.

  abstract = {© 2018 Objectives: There remains a need to identify effective smoking cessation interventions in severely disadvantaged populations. This trial aimed to examine the effectiveness of an intervention (Call it Quits) developed to promote smoking cessation and delivered by community social service case-workers. Methods: Call it Quits was a pragmatic, parallel randomised trial of a case-worker delivered smoking cessation intervention conducted in a non-government community social service organisation in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Adult smokers requiring financial assistance were randomly assigned to the five-session Call it Quits intervention or usual care control group. Of the 618 eligible individuals, 300 were randomised to the intervention group, of whom 187 (62\%) consented and 318 were randomised to the control group, of whom 244 (77\%) consented, resulting in 431 participants. The primary outcome measure was self-reported continuous abstinence up to 6-month follow-up with biochemical verification. Primary analysis was performed using all the available data from participants under the assumption the data is missing completely at random, followed by sensitivity analyses. Results: No statistically significant differences in the primary outcome were found (1.4\% in the control group versus 1.0\% in the intervention group, OR = 0.77, p = 0.828). Conclusions: A multi-component smoking cessation intervention delivering motivational interviewing-based counselling and free NRT by a trained case-worker within a community social service setting was not effective at achieving abstinence in a highly disadvantaged sample of smokers but increased attempts to stop and led to a reduction in number of cigarettes smoked daily.},

  abstract = {© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Purpose: To examine the longitudinal association between diet quality and depression using prospective data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health. Methods: Women born in 1946–1951 (n = 7877) were followed over 9 years starting from 2001. Dietary intake was assessed using the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies (version 2) in 2001 and a shortened form in 2007 and 2010. Diet quality was summarised using the Australian Recommended Food Score. Depression was measured using the 10-item Centre for Epidemiologic Depression Scale and self-reported physician diagnosis. Pooled logistic regression models including time-varying covariates were used to examine associations between diet quality tertiles and depression. Women were also categorised based on changes in diet quality during 2001–2007. Analyses were adjusted for potential confounders. Results: The highest tertile of diet quality was associated marginally with lower odds of depression (OR 0.94; 95 \% CI 0.83, 1.00; P = 0.049) although no significant linear trend was observed across tertiles (OR 1.00; 95 \% CI 0.94, 1.10; P = 0.48). Women who maintained a moderate or high score over 6 years had a 6–14 \% reduced odds of depression compared with women who maintained a low score (moderate vs low score—OR 0.94; 95 \% CI 0.80, 0.99; P = 0.045; high vs low score—OR 0.86; 95 \% CI 0.77, 0.96; P = 0.01). Similar results were observed in analyses excluding women with prior history of depression. Conclusion: Long-term maintenance of good diet quality may be associated with reduced odds of depression. Randomised controlled trials are needed to eliminate the possibility of residual confounding.},

  abstract = {The precursor for nerve growth factor (proNGF) is expressed in some cancers but its clinicopathological significance is unclear. The present study aimed to define the clinicopathological significance of proNGF in thyroid cancer. ProNGF expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry in two cohorts of cancer versus benign tumors (adenoma) and normal thyroid tissues. In the first cohort (40 thyroid cancers, 40 thyroid adenomas and 80 normal thyroid tissues), proNGF was found overexpressed in cancers compared to adenomas and normal samples (p{\textless}0.0001). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.84 (95\% CI 0.75-0.93, p{\textless}0.0001) for cancers versus adenomas, and 0.99 (95\% CI 0.98-1.00, p{\textless}0.0001) for cancers versus normal tissues. ProNGF overexpression was confirmed in a second cohort (127 cancers of various histological types and 55 normal thyroid tissues) and using a different antibody (p{\textless}0.0001). ProNGF staining intensity was highest in papillary carcinomas compared to other histological types (p{\textless}0.0001) and there was no significant association with age, gender, tumor size, stage and lymph node status. In conclusion, proNGF is increased in thyroid cancer and should be considered as a new potential diagnostic biomarker.},

Purpose: To assess the convergent validity of the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) depression measures relative to legacy measures and criterion validity against a structured diagnostic interview for depression in an oncology sample. Methods: 132 oncology/haematology outpatients completed the PROMIS Depression Computer Adaptive Test (PROMIS-D-CAT) and PROMIS Depression Short Form (PROMIS-D-SF) along with seven legacy measures: Beck Depression Inventory (BDI); Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D); Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; Patient Health Questionnaire; Distress Thermometer and PSYCH-6. Correlations, area under the curve (AUC) and diagnostic accuracy statistics were calculated with Structured Clinical Interview as the gold standard. Results: Both PROMIS measures correlated with all legacy measures at p {\textless}.001 (ρ = 0.589–0.810) and all AUCs ({\textgreater} 0.800) were comparable. At the cut-off points for mild depression of 53, the PROMIS measures had sensitivity (0.83 for PROMIS-D-CAT and 0.80 for PROMIS-D-SF) similar to or better than 6/7 legacy measures with high negative predictive value ({\textgreater} 90\%). At cut-off points of 60 for moderate depression, PROMIS measures had specificity {\textgreater} 90\%, similar to or better than all legacy measures and positive predictive value ≥ 0.50 (similar to 5/7 legacy measures). Conclusions: The convergent and criterion validity of the PROMIS depression measures in cancer populations was confirmed, although the optimal cut-off points are not established. PROMIS measures were briefer than BDI-II and CES-D but do not offer any advance in terms of diagnostic accuracy, reduced response burden or cost over other legacy measures of depression in oncology patients.},

Background: Currently, there is no single validated biomarker which can prognosticate survival in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study examines the prognostic significance of four biomarkers: neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte to monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) in patients with stage IV NSCLC. Methods: This study aimed to establish the relationship between NLR, LMR, PLR, ALI and overall survival (OS) at baseline and post first cycle of treatment using Cox univariate PH models. We also studied these biomarkers in the elderly (age ≥70 years). Clinical data was sourced from Calvary Mater Newcastle between 2010 and 2015. Results: Baseline NLR, PLR, LMR and ALI showed strong association with OS. Five unit increase in NLR and PLR was associated with an 11\% and 0.5\% increase in the hazard of death respectively while 1 unit increase in ALI resulted in 4\% increase in hazard of death. Five unit increase in LMR was associated with a 50\% reduction in hazard of death. Post-treatment NLR and low ALI correlated with shorter OS but no statistically significant relationship could be demonstrated for PLR nor LMR. Similar prognostic trends were noted for elderly. Conclusions: High NLR, high PLR, low LMR and low ALI at baseline are significantly associated with poor OS. High NLR and low ALI are significantly associated with poor OS post treatment. Findings are similar regardless of age.},

Methods: Databases and the grey literature were systematically searched to December 2015. Studies describing the prevalence of ENDS use in the general population aged ≤20 years in a defined geographical region were included. Where multiple estimates were available within countries, prevalence estimates of ENDS use were pooled for each country separately. Results: Data from 27 publications (36 surveys) from 13 countries were included. The prevalence of ENDS ever use in 2013–2015 among youth were highest in Poland (62.1\%; 95\%CI: 59.9-64.2\%), and lowest in Italy (5.9\%; 95\%CI: 3.3-9.2\%). Among non-smoking youth, the prevalence of ENDS ever use in 2013–2015 varied, ranging from 4.2\% (95\%CI: 3.8-4.6\%) in the US to 14.0\% in New Zealand (95\%CI: 12.7-15.4\%). The prevalence of ENDS ever use among current tobacco smoking youth was the highest in Canada (71.9\%, 95\%CI: 70.9-72.8\%) and lowest in Italy (29.9\%, 95\%CI: 18.5-42.5\%). Between 2008 and 2015, ENDS ever use among youth increased in Poland, Korea, New Zealand and the US; decreased in Italy and Canada; and remained stable in the UK. Conclusions: There is considerable heterogeneity in ENDS use among youth globally across countries and also between current smokers and non-smokers. Implications for public health: Population-level survey data on ENDS use is needed to inform public health policy and messaging globally.},

Methods: Cross-sectional survey of 197 participants attending a major regional hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine correlates of under-screening. Results: A total of 59\% reported either FOBT in the past two years or colonoscopy in the past five years. Of those reporting colonoscopy in the past five years, 21\% were potentially over-screened. Males were more likely than females to be under-screened. Of those under-screened (41\%), fewer than half were willing to receive screening advice. Conclusions and implications for public health: A significant proportion of people attending outpatient clinics are under-screened for CRC, with some people also over-screened.

Consenting clients attending two AOD outpatient clinics answered demographics, treatment questions and the Patient Health Questionnaire to assess depressive symptoms. Counts and percentages were calculated to determine the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms. Logistic regression was used to model the odds of having elevated depressive symptoms for client demographics. Of the 203 clients who completed the survey (87\% consent rate), 55\% (n = 111) demonstrated elevated depressive symptoms. Females were twice as likely to experience elevated symptoms of depression compared to males (OR 2.07; 95\% CI 1.05, 4.08; P = 0.037). The high rates of elevated depressive symptoms among individuals seeking AOD treatment highlight the importance of ongoing research to provide effective treatments for this comorbidity. Routine screening and clear treatment pathways may assist with providing high quality care.},

Excessive opioid prescribing can lead to adverse consequences including stockpiling, misuse, dependency, diversion and mortality. Increased prescriptions to post-operative inpatients as part of their discharge planning may be a significant contributor. Primary aims included comparing the amount of opioids prescribed, consumed, left unused and their relationship with pain and functionality. A total of 132 consecutive patients who underwent elective orthopaedic surgery were prospectively audited. Daily oral morphine equivalent (DME) of opioids prescribed was compared with opioids consumed and amount left unused 7-10 days after discharge. For analysis, patients were split into three groups: total knee replacement (TKR), hand surgery (Hands), and miscellaneous (Misc). The mean dose of opioid prescribed per patient was 108.5 mg DME. TKR consumed 33-35\% more opioids than Misc (p=0.0283) and Hands (p=0.0975). Age was a significant independent factor for opioid consumption in the 50th and 75th percentiles of Hands (p≤0.05). An average of 36 mg DME per patient was left unused with Hands having the highest median DME (37 mg) unused. In the total cohort, 26\% of patients were discharged with more DME than their last 24 h as an inpatient and had at least 50\% of their tablets left unused at follow-up. Over-prescription of opioids occurs at discharge which can increase the risk of harm. New intervention is needed to optimise prescribing practises. Changes to prescribing habits and workplace culture are required to minimise unnecessary opioid prescribing but will be challenging to implement. A multi-layered approach of electronic prescribing, opioid stewardship and targeted educational awareness programmes is recommended.},

Objective: The system of care in the Hunter New England Local Health District for patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) foresees pre-hospital thrombolysis (PHT) administered by paramedics to patients more than 60 minutes from the cardiac catheterisation laboratory (CCL), and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) at the CCL for others. We assessed the safety and effectiveness of the pre-hospital diagnosis strategy, which allocates patients to PHT or primary PCI according to travel time to the CCL. Design, setting and participants: Prospective, non-randomised, consecutive, single-centre case series of STEMI patients diagnosed on the basis of a pre-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG), from August 2008 to August 2013. All patients were treated at the tertiary referral hospital (John Hunter Hospital, Newcastle). Main outcome measures: The primary efficacy endpoint was all-cause mortality at 12 months; the primary safety endpoint was bleeding. Results: STEMI was diagnosed in 484 patients on the basis of pre-hospital ECG; 150 were administered PHT and 334 underwent primary PCI. The median time from first medical contact (FMC) to PHT was 35 minutes (IQR, 28–43 min) and to balloon inflation 130 minutes (IQR, 100–150 min). In the PHT group, 37 patients (27\%) needed rescue PCI (median time, 4 h; IQR, 3–5 h). The 12-month all-cause mortality rate was 7.0\% (PHT, 6.7\%; PCI, 7.2\%). The incidence of major bleeding (TIMI criteria) in the PHT group was 1.3\%; no patients in the primary PCI group experienced major bleeding. Conclusion: PHT can be delivered safely by paramedical staff in regional and rural Australia with good clinical outcomes.},

It is not known whether psychological outcomes differ according to the treatment sequence (chemotherapy or surgery first)or tumour response. Methods: This was a planned analysis of a multi-institutional single arm longitudinal study of patients considering NAST for operable breast cancer. Participants completed patient reported outcome questionnaires before and after the decision about NAST, between chemotherapy and surgery, and 12 months after diagnosis. Results: Fifty-nine women enrolled. Fourteen of 51 (28\%)who received NAST experienced pathological complete response (pCR). Patients who had surgery first (n = 7)had higher baseline anxiety, and a greater decrease in anxiety at 12 months follow up, compared with patients who received NAST (n = 50)(a decrease from baseline of 34 pts vs 17 points; p = 0.033). Distress declined at a similar rate in surgery first and NAST groups. Mean satisfaction with decision score post-decision was significantly lower in the adjuvant group compared with NAST (22 vs 26, p = 0.02). No differences were seen between patients with pCR vs residual cancer in: distress, anxiety, satisfaction with decision, fear of progression, and decision regret. Conclusion: Most patients in this study proceeded with NAST when their surgeon offered it as an option. This exploratory analysis suggests that patients who chose surgery first tended to be more anxious, and had lower satisfaction with their decision, than those who had NAST. In patients who had NAST, lack of pCR does not appear to correlate with adverse psychological outcomes.},

We examined associations in a prospective cohort study, adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and family factors. Methods: We recruited 1927 children from grade 7 classes (mean age 13 years), and one of their parents, in three Australian states, contacted participants annually from 2010 to 2014, and analysed data from assessments at ages 13, 14, 15 and 16 years. We used the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) subscale to identify hazardous drinking in parents (score ≥5) and children (score ≥3) and constructed mixed-effect logistic regression models, accounting for clustering within school and adjusting for likely confounders. We evaluated the sensitivity of estimates by imputing missing values assuming the data were missing at random vs. missing not at random. Results: Parent hazardous drinking predicted mid-adolescent hazardous drinking, e.g. 15 years olds whose parents [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.00; 95\% confidence interval 1.51-2.64] or parents' partners (aOR 1.94; 1.48-2.55) were hazardous drinkers had higher odds of being hazardous drinkers at age 16. The magnitude of univariate associations changed little after adjusting for covariates, and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the association, across a wide range of assumptions about the missing data. Conclusions: The associations between parents' and their adolescent children's hazardous drinking are unlikely to be due to confounding by socio-demographic and family factors. Parents should be encouraged, and supported by public policy, to reduce their own alcohol consumption in order to reduce their children's risk of becoming hazardous drinkers.},

  abstract = {© 2017 The Authors ESC Heart Failure published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd on behalf of European Society of Cardiology Aims: The aim of the current study is to examine 10 year trends in mortality and readmission following heart failure (HF) hospitalization in metropolitan and regional Australian settings. Methods and results: We identified all index HF hospitalizations in the Hunter New England region from 2005 to 2014, using a 10 year ‘look back’ period. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or all-cause readmission at 1 year. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, all-cause readmission, and HF readmission at 30 days and 1 year. We used logistic regression to explore the predictors of the composite outcome of either all-cause death or readmission at 1 year. There were 12 114 patients admitted with a first episode of HF between 2005 and 2014, followed up until death or the end of 2015. The mean age was 78 ± 12 years and 49\% (n = 5906) were male. A total of 4831 (40\%) resided in regional areas and the remainder in metropolitan areas. One hundred sixty-eight patients (1.4\%) were Aboriginal. Approximately 69\% of patients had either died or been readmitted for any cause within 12 months of their index event. The 30 day and 1 year all-cause mortality rates were 13\% and 32\%, respectively, with no change in the trend over the study period. Age, socio-economic disadvantage, ischaemic heart disease, renal failure, and chronic lower respiratory disease were predictors of the primary endpoint. Conclusions: Heart failure hospitalizations are followed by high rates of death or readmission. There was no change in this composite endpoint over the 10 year study period.},

In this study, the neurotrophin tyrosine receptor kinase TrkA (also called NTRK1), the common neurotrophin receptor p75NTR, and the proneurotrophin receptor sortilin were analyzed with immunohistochemistry in a cohort of thyroid cancers (n = 128) and compared with adenomas and normal thyroid tissues (n = 62). TrkA was detected in 20\% of thyroid cancers, compared with none of the benign samples (P = 0.0007). TrkA expression was independent of histologic subtypes but associated with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.0148), suggesting the involvement of TrkA in tumor invasiveness. Nerves in the tumor microenvironment were positive for TrkA. p75NTR was overexpressed in anaplastic thyroid cancers compared with papillary and follicular subtypes (P {\textless} 0.0001). Sortilin was overexpressed in thyroid cancers compared with benign thyroid tissues (P {\textless} 0.0001). Neurotrophin receptor expression was confirmed in a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines at the mRNA and protein levels. Functional investigations using the anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line CAL-62 found that siRNA against TrkA, p75NTR, and sortilin decreased cell survival and cell migration through decreased SRC and ERK activation. Together, these data reveal TrkA, p75NTR, and sortilin as potential therapeutic targets in thyroid cancer.},

  abstract = {© 2017 The Author(s). Background: Internationally, governments have implemented school-based nutrition policies to restrict the availability of unhealthy foods from sale. The aim of the trial was to assess the effectiveness of a multi-strategic intervention to increase implementation of a state-wide healthy canteen policy. The impact of the intervention on the energy, total fat, and sodium of children's canteen purchases and on schools' canteen revenue was also assessed. Methods: Australian primary schools with a canteen were randomised to receive a 12-14-month, multi-strategic intervention or to a no intervention control group. The intervention sought to increase implementation of a state-wide healthy canteen policy which required schools to remove unhealthy items (classified as 'red' or 'banned') from regular sale and encouraged schools to 'fill the menu' with healthy items (classified as 'green'). The intervention strategies included allocation of a support officer to assist with policy implementation, engagement of school principals and parent committees, consensus processes with canteen managers, training, provision of tools and resources, academic detailing, performance feedback, recognition and marketing initiatives. Data were collected at baseline (April to September, 2013) and at completion of the implementation period (November, 2014 to April, 2015). Results: Seventy schools participated in the trial. Relative to control, at follow-up, intervention schools were significantly more likely to have menus without 'red' or 'banned' items (RR=21.11; 95\% CI 3.30 to 147.28; p≤0.01) and to have at least 50\% of menu items classified as 'green' (RR=3.06; 95\% CI 1.64 to 5.68; p≤0.01). At follow-up, student purchases from intervention school canteens were significantly lower in total fat (difference=-1.51g; 95\% CI -2.84 to -0.18; p=0.028) compared to controls, but not in energy (difference=-132.32kJ; 95\% CI -280.99 to 16.34; p=0.080) or sodium (difference=-46.81mg; 95\% CI -96.97 to 3.35; p=0.067). Canteen revenue did not differ significantly between groups. Conclusion: Poor implementation of evidence-based school nutrition policies is a problem experienced by governments internationally, and one with significant implications for public health. The study makes an important contribution to the limited experimental evidence regarding strategies to improve implementation of school nutrition policies and suggests that, with multi-strategic support, implementation of healthy canteen policies can be achieved in most schools.

Background: While there are number of frameworks which focus on supporting the implementation of evidence based approaches, few psychometrically valid measures exist to assess constructs within these frameworks. This study aimed to develop and psychometrically assess a scale measuring each domain of the Theoretical Domains Framework for use in assessing the implementation of dietary guidelines within a non-health care setting (childcare services). Methods: A 75 item 14-domain Theoretical Domains Framework Questionnaire (TDFQ) was developed and administered via telephone interview to 202 centre based childcare service cooks who had a role in planning the service menu. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was undertaken to assess the reliability, discriminant validity and goodness of fit of the 14-domain theoretical domain framework measure. Results: For the CFA, five iterative processes of adjustment were undertaken where 14 items were removed, resulting in a final measure consisting of 14 domains and 61 items. For the final measure: the Chi-Square goodness of fit statistic was 3447.19; the Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR) was 0.070; the Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA) was 0.072; and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI) had a value of 0.78. Conclusions: While only one of the three indices support goodness of fit of the measurement model tested, a 14-domain model with 61 items showed good discriminant validity and internally consistent items. Future research should aim to assess the psychometric properties of the developed TDFQ in other community-based settings.},

  abstract = {© 2018 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma \& Immunology Background: The single-center double-blind, randomized controlled Managing Asthma in Pregnancy (MAP) trial in Newcastle, Australia, compared a treatment algorithm using the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) in combination with asthma symptoms (FENO group) against a treatment algorithm using clinical symptoms only (clinical group) in pregnant asthmatic women (Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, no. 12607000561482). The primary outcome was a 50\% reduction in asthma exacerbations during pregnancy in the FENO group. However, the effect of FENO-guided management on the development of asthma in the offspring is unknown. Objective: We sought to investigate the effect of FENO-guided asthma management during pregnancy on asthma incidence in childhood. Methods: A total of 179 mothers consented to participate in the Growing into Asthma (GIA) double-blind follow-up study with the primary aim to determine the effect of FENO-guided asthma management on childhood asthma incidence. Results: A total of 140 children (78\%) were followed up at 4 to 6 years of age. FENO-guided as compared to symptoms-only approach significantly reduced doctor-diagnosed asthma (25.9\% vs 43.2\%; odds ratio [OR], 0.46, 95\% CI, 0.22-0.96; P =.04). Furthermore, frequent wheeze (OR, 0.27; 95\% CI, 0.09-0.87; P =.03), use of short-acting β-agonists (OR, 0.49; 95\% CI, 0.25-0.97; P =.04), and emergency department visits for asthma (OR, 0.17; 95\% CI, 0.04-0.76; P =.02) in the past 12 months were less common in children born to mothers from the FENO group. Doctor-diagnosed asthma was associated with common risk alleles for early onset asthma at gene locus 17q21 (P =.01 for rs8069176; P =.03 for rs8076131), and higher airways resistance (P =.02) and FENO levels (P =.03). A causal mediation analysis suggested natural indirect effects of FENO-guided asthma management on childhood asthma through “any use” and “time to first change in dose” of inhaled corticosteroids during the MAP trial (OR: 0.83; 95\% CI: 0.59-0.99, and OR: 0.90; 95\% CI: 0.70-1.03, respectively). Conclusions: FENO-guided asthma management during pregnancy prevented doctor-diagnosed asthma in the offspring at preschool age, in part mediated through changes in use and dosing of inhaled corticosteroids during the MAP trial.},

This study aims to describe changes in diet quality over 12 years among participants in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health in relation to changes in depressive symptoms. Women born between 1946 and 1951 were followed-up for 12 years (2001-2013). Dietary intake was assessed using the Dietary Questionnaire for Epidemiological Studies (version 2) in 2001, 2007 and every 2-3 years after that until 2013. Diet quality was summarised using the Australian Recommended Food Score (ARFS). Depressive symptoms were measured using the ten-item Centre for Epidemiologic Depression Scale at every 2-3-year intervals during 2001-2013. Linear mixed models were used to examine trends in diet quality and its sub-components. The same model including time-varying covariates was used to examine associations between diet quality and depressive symptoms adjusting for confounders. Sensitivity analyses were carried out using the Mediterranean dietary pattern (MDP) index to assess diet quality. Minimal changes in overall diet quality and its sub-components over 12 years were observed. There was a significant association between baseline diet quality and depression (β=-0 24, P=0 001), but this was lost when time-varying covariates were added (β=-0 04, P=0 10). Sensitivity analyses showed similar performance for both ARFS and MDP in predicting depressive symptoms. In conclusion, initial associations seen when using baseline measures of diet quality and depressive symptoms disappear when using methods that handle time-varying covariates, suggesting that previous studies indicating a relationship between diet and depression may have been affected by residual confounding.},

A retrospective observational cohort study was conducted to document patients who were identified as an acute hospital presentation of assault occasioning facial injury. The period of study was 2003–2015; this ensured a similar period of time before and after the implementation of the legislation in 2008. A statistical analysis was undertaken to assess the rates of change in oral and maxillofacial (OMF) assault admissions pre and post legislation. The study found that pre-legislation numbers of OMF assaults increased at a rate of 14\% per annum and then decreased at a rate of 21\% per annum post legislation (31\% relative rate ratio reduction). Similar trends were seen for all males, males aged 18–35 years, and males where alcohol was recorded at clinical presentation. The introduction of ‘last drinks’ and ‘lock out’ legislation has led to a significant and sustained reduction in assaultive alcohol-related facial injury in Newcastle.},

In this issue of the Journal, Isanaka et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2016;184(12):861-869) set out to update an incidence correction factor used for estimating numbers of cases of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in children aged 6-59 months. The total number of current SAM cases (prevalent cases) increases by the number of new (incident) cases and decreases as a result of recovery or death. Prevalence estimates are obtained from crosssectional surveys. Calculation of incidence typically requires longitudinal data, which evidently are rarely collected for SAM, and so a correction factor is applied instead. Isanaka et al. pool and meta-analyze data from longitudinal and community programs in 3 West African countries (Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso), covering the period 2009-2012. Heterogeneity and the ongoing lack of data undermine the use of a single incidence correction factor for SAM estimates. Routine data collection is recommended as a way forward and aligns with recommendations of the World Health Organization. This commentary helps to outline a context for the use of such data and provide some perspective on the inadequacy of data, relative to the importance of the issue.},

Background and Purpose: In alteplase-treated patients with acute ischemic stroke, we investigated the relationship between penumbral reperfusion at 24 hours and clinical outcomes, with and without adjustment for baseline ischemic core volume. Methods: Data were collected from consecutive acute ischemic stroke patients with baseline and follow-up perfusion imaging presenting to hospital within 4.5 hours of symptom onset at 7 hospitals. Logistic regression models were used for predicting the effect of the reperfused penumbral volume on the dichotomized modified Rankin Scale (MRS) at 90 days and improvement of National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale at 24 hours, both adjusted for baseline ischemic core volume. Results: This study included 1507 patients. Reperfused penumbral volume had moderate ability to predict 90-day MRS 0 to 1 (area under the curve, 0.77; R2, 0.28; P{\textless}0.0001). However, after adjusting for baseline ischemic core volume, the reperfused penumbral volume was a strong predictor of good functional outcome (area under the curve, 0.946; R2, 0.55; P{\textless}0.0001). For every 1\% increase in penumbral reperfusion, the odds of achieving MRS 0 to 1 at day 90 increased by 7.4\%. Improvement in acute 24-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was also significantly related to the degree of reperfused penumbra (R2, 0.31; P{\textless}0.0001). This association was again stronger after adjustment for baseline ischemic core volume (R2, 0.41; P{\textless}0.0001). For each 1\% of penumbra that was reperfused, the 24-hour National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale decreased by 0.069 compared with baseline. Conclusions: In patients treated with alteplase, the extent of the penumbra that is reperfused is a powerful predictor of early and late clinical outcomes, particularly when baseline ischemic core is taken into account.},

  abstract = {© 2016 Elsevier Inc. Antioxidants and fatty acids are associated with depression and inflammation, and inflammation appears to predict depression risk; hence, the associations between these nutrients and depression may be mediated by inflammation. We hypothesized that inflammatory markers interleukin (IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) mediate the associations between antioxidant and fatty acid intakes, and depression. Participants were from the Hunter Community Study, a longitudinal cohort of adults aged 55-85 years. Dietary intake was assessed using the Older Australian's Food Frequency Questionnaire. Fasting blood samples were drawn for analysis of nutrient and inflammatory biomarkers. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale at baseline and at 5-year follow-up. Linear mixed models were used to investigate longitudinal associations between dietary intakes and depression, and mediation analyses were carried out to determine if IL-6 and/or CRP were the mediators. Analyses were conducted on men and women separately and adjusted for potential confounders. Fruit and monounsaturated fat intakes were negatively associated with depression, whereas total fat and saturated fat intakes were positively associated with depression in both sexes. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fat was inversely associated with depression in men only. IL-6 was a significant mediator of the association between fruits with low carotenoid content and depression in women. CRP significantly mediated the relationship between total fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat intakes and depression in women, and saturated fat intake and depression in men. Our findings raise the possibility that the association between fatty acid intake and depression is partially mediated by inflammatory markers.},

Given the time-limited nature of consultations, a new and more time-efficient approach is needed which addresses multiple health needs simultaneously, and encourages patient self-management to address health risks. The aim of this cluster randomised controlled trial is to test the effectiveness of a patient feedback intervention in improving patient self-management of health needs related to smoking, risky alcohol consumption and underscreening for cancers at 1 month follow-up. Methods and analysis: Adult general practice patients will be invited to participate in a baseline survey to assess cancer risk factors, screening needs and depression. A total of 360 participants identified by the baseline survey as having at least one health need (a self-reported cancer risk factor, underscreening for cancer, or an elevated depression score) will be randomised to an intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group will receive tailored printed feedback summarising their identified health needs and recommended self-management actions to address these. All participants will be invited to complete a telephone interview 1 month following recruitment to assess self-management actions taken in relation to health needs identified in the baseline survey. Control group participants will receive tailored printed feedback on their identified health needs after their follow-up interview. A logistic regression model, with group allocation as the main predictor, will be used to assess the impact of the intervention on self-management actions. Ethical considerations and dissemination Participants identified as being at risk of depression will be advised to speak with their doctor. Results will be disseminated via publication in peer-reviewed journals. The study has been approved by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee.},

Depression is a common and debilitating condition. In Australia, general practitioners (GPs) are the key providers of depression care. However, available evidence suggests that case finding for depression in primary care is poor. This study will examine whether a systematic approach to screening for depression and assessing patient preferences for depression care improves depression outcomes among primary care patients. Methods and analysis A cluster randomised controlled design will be used with general practice clinics randomly assigned to either the intervention (n=12) or usual care group (n=12). Patients who are aged 18 and older, presenting for general practice care, will be eligible to participate. Eighty-three participants will be recruited at each clinic. Participants will be asked to complete a baseline survey administered on a touch screen computer at their GP clinic, and then a follow-up survey at 3, 6 and 12 months. Those attending usual care practices will receive standard care. GPs at intervention practices will complete an online Clinical e-Audit, and will be provided with provider and patient-directed resources for depression care. Patients recruited at intervention practices who score 10 or above on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 will have feedback regarding their depression screening results and preferences for care provided to their GP. The primary analysis will compare the number of cases of depression between the intervention and control groups. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee, and registered with Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of Wollongong, Monash University and University of New South Wales. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications and conference presentations. Trial registration number ACTRN12618001139268; Pre-results.},

  abstract = {AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:This study aimed to reduce indwelling urinary catheter (IDC) use and duration through implementation of a multifaceted "bundled" care intervention. BACKGROUND:IDCs present a risk for patients through the potential development of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), with duration of IDC a key risk factor. CAUTI is considered preventable yet accounts for over a third of all hospital acquired infections. The most effective CAUTI reduction strategy is to avoid IDC use where ever possible and to remove the IDC as early as appropriate. DESIGN:A cluster-controlled pre-post study at a facility level with a phased intervention implementation approach. METHODS:A multifaceted intervention involving a "No CAUTI" catheter care bundle was implemented, in 4 acute care hospitals, 2 in metropolitan and 2 in rural locations, in New South Wales, Australia. IDC point prevalence and duration data were collected at the bedside on 1,630 adult inpatients at pre-intervention and 1677 and 1551 at 4 and 9 months post-intervention. This study is presented in line with the StaRI checklist (See Supplementary File 1). RESULTS:A non-significant trend towards reduction in IDC prevalence was identified, from 12\% pre-intervention to 10\% of all inpatients at 4 and 9 months. Variability in pre intervention IDC prevalence existed across hospitals (8\% to 16\%). Variability in reduction was evident across hospitals at 4 months (between -2\% and 4\%) and 9 months (between 0\% and 8\%). Hospitals with higher pre-intervention prevalence showed larger decreases; up to 50\% when pre-intervention prevalence was 16\%. IDC duration increased as more of the short term IDC placements were avoided. CONCLUSIONS:Implementation of a multifaceted intervention resulted in reduced IDC use in four acute care hospitals in Australia. This result was not statistically significant but did reflect a positive trend of reduction. There was a significant reduction in short term IDC use at 9 months post intervention. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE:Clinical nurse leaders can effectively implement change strategies that influence patient outcomes. Implementation of the evidence-based "No CAUTI" bundle increased awareness of appropriate indications and provided nurses with the tools to inform decision making related to insertion and removal of IDCs in acute inpatient settings. Working in partnership with inpatients and the multidisciplinary team is essential in minimising acute care IDC use.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:There is an established association between fast-food consumption and metabolic diseases. Some studies also suggest that calorie-dense food promotes a proinflammatory response, which is itself linked with myocardial infarction (MI). Whether increased fast-food availability is a risk factor for MI remains unknown. AIM:To investigate the role of fast-food outlet density as a novel environmental risk factor for myocardial infarction in the Hunter region, NSW. METHODS:We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a database of all MI events between 1996-2013, extracted from the Hunter Cardiac and Stroke Outcomes unit. Fast-food outlet density (FFD) was calculated for each local government area (LGA) of the Hunter region, allowing for a comparative analysis. Stratification by fast-food outlet data and LGA resulted in a total of 3070 cases. Weighted linear regression was used to investigate the role of fast food outlet density on incidence of myocardial infarction in regional and rural Australia. RESULTS:FFD was positively correlated with rates of MI, remaining consistent in both single and multivariate predictor models adjusting for age, obesity, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, smoking status, diabetes and socioeconomic status (p {\textless} 0.001). An increase of one fast-food outlet corresponded with four additional cases of MI per 100 000 people per year (4.07, 95\% CI. 3.86-4.28). CONCLUSIONS:Fast-food outlet density was positively associated with incidence of myocardial infarction in both rural and metropolitan areas of NSW. This relationship remained consistent after multivariate adjustment for standard cardiovascular risk factors, highlighting the importance of an individual's food environment as a potential contributor towards their health.

  abstract = {© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Background Bronchiolitis is the most common lung infection in infants and treatment focuses on management of respiratory distress and hypoxia. High-flow warm humidified oxygen (HFWHO) is increasingly used, but has not been rigorously studied in randomised trials. We aimed to examine whether HFWHO provided enhanced respiratory support, thereby shortening time to weaning off oxygen. Methods In this open, phase 4, randomised controlled trial, we recruited children aged less than 24 months with moderate bronchiolitis attending the emergency department of the John Hunter Hospital or the medical unit of the John Hunter Children's Hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) via opaque sealed envelopes to HFWHO (maximum flow of 1 L/kg per min to a limit of 20 L/min using 1:1 air–oxygen ratio, resulting in a maximum FiO2 of 0·6) or standard therapy (cold wall oxygen 100\% via infant nasal cannulae at low flow to a maximum of 2 L/min) using a block size of four and stratifying for gestational age at birth. The primary outcome was time from randomisation to last use of oxygen therapy. All randomised children were included in the primary and secondary safety analyses. This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12612000685819. Findings From July 16, 2012, to May 1, 2015, we randomly assigned 202 children to either HFWHO (101 children) or standard therapy (101 children). Median time to weaning was 24 h (95\% CI 18–28) for standard therapy and 20 h (95\% CI 17–34) for HFWHO (hazard ratio [HR] for difference in survival distributions 0·9 [95\% CI 0·7–1·2]; log rank p=0·61). Fewer children experienced treatment failure on HFWHO (14 [14\%]) compared with standard therapy (33 [33\%]; p=0·0016); of these children, those on HFWHO were supported for longer than were those on standard therapy before treatment failure (HR 0·3; 95\% CI 0·2–0·6; p{\textless}0·0001). 20 (61\%) of 33 children who experienced treatment failure on standard therapy were rescued with HFWHO. 12 (12\%) of children on standard therapy required transfer to the intensive care unit compared with 14 (14\%) of those on HFWHO (difference −1\%; 95\% CI −7 to 16; p=0·41). Four adverse events occurred (oxygen desaturation and condensation inhalation in the HFWHO group, and two incidences of oxygen tubing disconnection in the standard therapy group); none resulted in withdrawal from the trial. No oxygen-related serious adverse events occurred. Secondary effectiveness outcomes are reported in the Results section. Interpretation HFWHO did not significantly reduce time on oxygen compared with standard therapy, suggesting that early use of HFWHO does not modify the underlying disease process in moderately severe bronchiolitis. HFWHO might have a role as a rescue therapy to reduce the proportion of children requiring high-cost intensive care.

  abstract = {© 2018 World Stroke Organization. Background: Stroke survivors sit for long periods each day. Uninterrupted sitting is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Breaking up uninterrupted sitting with frequent, short bouts of light-intensity physical activity has an immediate positive effect on blood pressure and plasma clotting factors in healthy, overweight, and type 2 diabetic populations. Aim: We examined the effect of frequent, short bouts of light-intensity physical activity on blood pressure and plasma fibrinogen in stroke survivors. Methods: Prespecified secondary analyses from a three-armed randomized, within-participant, crossover trial. Participants were 19 stroke survivors (nine female, aged 68 years old, 90\% able to walk independently). The experimental conditions were sitting for 8 h uninterrupted, sitting with 3 min bouts of light-intensity exercise while standing every 30 min, or sitting with 3 min of walking every 30 min. Blood pressure was measured every 30 min over 8 h and plasma fibrinogen at the beginning, middle, and end of each day. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using linear mixed models including fixed effects for condition, period, and order, and a random intercept for participant to account for repeated measures and missing data. Results: Sitting with 3 min bouts of light-intensity exercise while standing every 30 min decreased systolic blood pressure by 3.5 mmHg (95\% CI 1.7–5.4) compared with sitting for 8 h uninterrupted. For participants not taking antihypertensive medications, sitting with 3 min of walking every 30 min decreased systolic blood pressure by 5.0 mmHg (95\% CI −7.9 to 2.0) and sitting with 3 min bouts light-intensity exercise while standing every 30 min decreased systolic blood pressure by 4.2 mmHg (95\% CI −7.2 to −1.3) compared with sitting for 8 h uninterrupted. There was no effect of condition on diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.45) or plasma fibrinogen levels (p = 0.91). Conclusion: Frequent, short bouts of light-intensity physical activity decreases systolic blood pressure in stroke survivors. However, before translation into clinical practice, the optimal duration and timing of physical activity bouts needs to be determined.

This study assessed the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of the EATS (Eating Advice to Students) brief (i.e., single use) web-based nutrition intervention for young adult university students. A 3-month pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 124 students aged 17–35 from the University of Newcastle, Australia. Participants were randomized to EATS (n = 62) or attention control (n = 62). EATS aimed to improve four target eating behaviors (vegetables, fruit, discretionary foods, breakfast). Primary outcomes were feasibility (recruitment, retention, usage, program acceptability). Recruitment and retention numbers were recorded, the program acceptability was assessed by a process evaluation survey and the website usage was objectively tracked. Preliminary efficacy was assessed via changes in diet quality (primary), fruit, vegetables, discretionary foods and breakfast intake, measured using Food Frequency Questionnaire. Recruitment was completed in five weeks. Retention was 73\% (90/124) at 3-months. Intervention participants used EATS 1.5 ± 1.0 times. Satisfaction with EATS was rated at 4.04 ± 0.74 (maximum five). Intervention participants significantly decreased the percentage energy/day from discretionary foods compared with control (−4.8\%, 95\%CI −8.6, −1.1, p = 0.012, d = −0.34). No significant between-group differences were observed for diet quality, fruit, vegetable or breakfast intakes. EATS demonstrated high feasibility, particularly for reach and acceptability. The university setting and a brief web-based intervention show promise in engaging young adults to improve their eating behaviors.},

This study aimed to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a) a co-designed multi-component intervention for HPs at Aboriginal Medical Services (AMSs) in culturally-targeted pregnancy-specific smoking cessation care and b) the study design. METHODS:Using a randomised step-wedge cluster design, the Indigenous Counselling And Nicotine (ICAN) QUIT in Pregnancy Trial was evaluated across six AMSs in three Australian states. HPs were provided educational resource packages including live interactive webinars, treatment manuals, patient resources, carbon monoxide (CO) meters, and oral Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT). Feasibility was assessed through recruitment and retention rates of both pregnant women (12-weeks) and HPs (end of study) as well as the potential to improve women's quit rates. Qualitative interviews with staff post-trial explored acceptability of the intervention and study, based on capability, opportunity and motivation from the Behaviour Change Wheel. RESULTS:Pregnant women (n = 22; 47\% (95\% CI: 32\%, 63\%) eligible) and HPs (n = 50; 54\% (95\% CI: 44\%, 64\%) eligible) were recruited over 6 months with retention rates of 77\% (95\% CI: 57\%, 90\%) and 40\% (95\% CI: 28\%, 54\%) respectively. Self-reported 12-week 7-day point-prevalence abstinence was 13.6\% (n = 3) and validated abstinent with CO readings ≤6 ppm. Staff interviewed regarding intervention implementation highlighted the importance of provision and use of resources, including training materials, patient resources, CO meters and oral NRT. Resources helped increase capability and opportunity, restructure the environment, and provided social comparison and modelling. Staff were motivated by greater engagement with pregnant women and seeing the women's reductions in CO readings. Having the intervention at the AMSs improved organisational capacity to engage with pregnant women. Staff reported changes to their routine practice that were potentially sustainable. Recommendations for improvement to the implementation of the intervention and research included reducing training length and the tasks related to conducting the study. CONCLUSION:ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy was a pilot study with the ability to enrol Indigenous women. It was feasible to implement and acceptable to most staff of the AMSs in three states, with modifications recommended. Smoking in pregnancy is a key challenge for Indigenous health. The intervention needs to be evaluated through a methodologically rigorous fully-powered study to determine the efficacy of outcomes for women.

Little is known about the sociodemographic and psychosocial factors associated with use of alcohol and tobacco in disadvantaged groups in comparison to low-risk users. Objectives: This study aimed to compare the characteristics of low-risk users with: disadvantaged smokers only; disadvantaged heavy drinkers only; and disadvantaged concurrent smokers and heavy drinkers. Methods: A cross-sectional survey of socioeconomically disadvantaged adult clients attending a community welfare agency assessed tobacco use, alcohol use, demographic, and psychosocial variables. Multivariable analysis using multinomial logistic regression was carried out. Results: The sample consisted of 835 participants; 40\% (n = 331) were concurrent users, 31\% were smokers only (n = 252), 11\% were heavy drinkers only (n = 93), and 18\% were low-risk users (n = 149). Compared with those who neither smoked nor consumed alcohol heavily, concurrent users were more likely to be younger, have only some contact with family, have more friends and family who were smokers, have no fixed home address, live alone, and have higher levels of financial stress. Most of these factors were shared by individuals who were smokers only. Factors associated with heavy drinkers only were frequent contact with family and having more friends and family who were smokers. Conclusion: Among those Australians who suffer severe economic hardship, being a concurrent smoker and heavy drinker appears to be associated with more isolated living conditions and financial stress but some contact with family.},

Studies investigating exceptionally long-lived (ELL) individuals, including genetic studies, have linked cardiovascular-related pathways, particularly lipid and cholesterol homeostasis, with longevity. This study explored the genetic profiles of ELL individuals (cases: n = 294, 95–106 years; controls: n = 1105, 55–65 years) by assessing their polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on a genome wide association study (GWAS) threshold of p {\textless} 5 × 10−5. PRS were constructed using GWAS summary data from two exceptional longevity (EL) analyses and eight cardiovascular-related risk factors (lipids) and disease (myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, stroke) analyses. A higher genetic risk for exceptional longevity (EL) was significantly associated with longevity in our sample (odds ratio (OR) = 1.19–1.20, p = 0.00804 and 0.00758, respectively). Two cardiovascular health PRS were nominally significant with longevity (HDL cholesterol, triglycerides), with higher PRS associated with EL, but these relationships did not survive correction for multiple testing. In conclusion, ELL individuals did not have significantly lower polygenic risk for the majority of the investigated cardiovascular health traits. Future work in larger cohorts is required to further explore the role of cardiovascular-related genetic variants in EL.},

Originally published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research (http://www.jmir.org), 28.08.2019. BACKGROUND: Variations in an individual's electronic health (eHealth) literacy may influence the degree to which health consumers can benefit from eHealth. The eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS) is a common measure of eHealth literacy. However, the lack of guidelines for the standardized interpretation of eHEALS scores limits its research and clinical utility. Cut points are often arbitrarily applied at the eHEALS item or global level, which assumes a dichotomy of high and low eHealth literacy. This approach disregards scale constructs and results in inaccurate and inconsistent conclusions. Cluster analysis is an exploratory technique, which can be used to overcome these issues, by identifying classes of patients reporting similar eHealth literacy without imposing data cut points. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this cross-sectional study was to identify classes of patients reporting similar eHealth literacy and assess characteristics associated with class membership. METHODS: Medical imaging outpatients were recruited consecutively in the waiting room of one major public hospital in New South Wales, Australia. Participants completed a self-report questionnaire assessing their sociodemographic characteristics and eHealth literacy, using the eHEALS. Latent class analysis was used to explore eHealth literacy clusters identified by a distance-based cluster analysis, and to identify characteristics associated with class membership. RESULTS: Of the 268 eligible and consenting participants, 256 (95.5\%) completed the eHEALS. Consistent with distance-based findings, 4 latent classes were identified, which were labeled as low (21.1\%, 54/256), moderate (26.2\%, 67/256), high (32.8\%, 84/256), and very high (19.9\%, 51/256) eHealth literacy. Compared with the low class, participants who preferred to receive a lot of health information reported significantly higher odds of moderate eHealth literacy (odds ratio 16.67, 95\% CI 1.67-100.00; P=.02), and those who used the internet at least daily reported significantly higher odds of high eHealth literacy (odds ratio 4.76, 95\% CI 1.59-14.29; P=.007). CONCLUSIONS: The identification of multiple classes of eHealth literacy, using both distance-based and latent class analyses, highlights the limitations of using the eHEALS global score as a dichotomous measurement tool. The findings suggest that eHealth literacy support needs vary in this population. The identification of low and moderate eHealth literacy classes indicate that the design of eHealth resources should be tailored to patients' varying levels of eHealth literacy. eHealth literacy improvement interventions are needed, and these should be targeted based on individuals' internet use frequency and health information amount preferences.},

  abstract = {Few randomized controlled trials (RCT) have evaluated the efficacy of web-based programs targeting maintenance of lost weight. The aims of this study were to evaluate two versions of a commercially available web-based weight loss maintenance (WLM) program and examine whether the provision of enhanced feedback was associated with better WLM. The study was an assessor-blinded RCT of change in body mass index (BMI) over 12 months WLM. Participants were 227 adults (44\% male, 42.3 ± 10.1 years, BMI 30.4 ± 4.1 kg/m²) randomized to either a basic (Basic WLM) or enhanced program with additional support (Enhanced WLM). Analysis was intention-to-treat with imputation using last observation carried forward. There was no significant weight rebound from the start of weight loss maintenance to 12 months for either group (mean: basic 1.3\%, enhanced 1.5\%) and limited change in secondary outcomes for either program. There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcome of change in BMI (basic -0.5 (1.9) kg/m², enhanced -0.5 (1.6) kg/m², p = 0.93). In conclusion, a web-based WLM program was effective in preventing weight regain over one year following weight loss. However, the addition of personalized e-feedback provided limited additional benefits compared to a standard program. Given the potential reach of web-based approaches, further research examining which web-based program components optimize weight outcomes long-term is required.},

The 'Physical Activity 4 Everyone' (PA4E1) study tested a multi-component physical activity intervention in 10 secondary schools from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. This paper aimed to report the secondary outcomes of the study; to determine whether the intervention impacted on adiposity outcomes (weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score), and whether any effect was moderated by sex, baseline BMI and baseline physical activity level, at 12 and 24 months.SUBJECTS/METHODS:A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in New South Wales, Australia. The school-based intervention included seven physical activity strategies targeting the following: curriculum (strategies to maximise physical activity in physical education, student physical activity plans, an enhanced school sport programme); school environment (physical activity during school breaks, modification of school policy); and parents and the community (parent engagement, links with community physical activity providers). Students' weight (kg), BMI and BMI z-score, were collected at baseline (Grade 7), 12 and 24 months. Linear Mixed Models were used to assess between-group mean difference from baseline to 12 and 24 months. Exploratory sub-analyses were undertaken according to three moderators of energy balance.RESULTS:A total of 1150 students (mean age=12 years) provided outcome data at baseline, 1051 (91\%) at 12 months and 985 (86\%) at 24 months. At 12 months, there were group-by-time effects for weight (mean difference=-0.90 kg (95\% confidence interval (CI)=-1.50, -0.30), P{\textless}0.01) and BMI (-0.28 kg m -2 (-0.50, -0.06), P=0.01) in favour of the intervention group, but not for BMI z-score (-0.05 (-0.11; 0.01), P=0.13). These findings were consistent for weight (-0.62 kg (-1.21, 0.03), P=0.01) and BMI (-0.28 kg m -2 (-0.49, -0.06), P=0.01) at 24 months, with group-by-time effects also found for BMI z-score (-0.08 (-0.14; -0.02), P=0.02) favouring the intervention group.CONCLUSION:The PA4E1 school-based intervention achieved moderate reductions in adiposity among adolescents from socio-economically disadvantaged communities. Multi-component interventions that increase adolescents' engagement in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) may assist in preventing unhealthy weight gain.},

  abstract = {Background: The translation of Web-based physical activity intervention research into the real world is lacking and becoming increasingly important. Objective: To compare usage and effectiveness, in real-world settings, of a traditional Web 1.0 Web-based physical activity intervention, providing limited interactivity, to a Web 2.0 Web-based physical activity intervention that includes interactive features, such as social networking (ie, status updates, online "friends," and personalized profile pages), blogs, and Google Maps mash-ups. Methods: Adults spontaneously signing up for the freely available 10,000 Steps website were randomized to the 10,000 Steps website (Web 1.0) or the newly developed WALK 2.0 website (Web 2.0). Physical activity (Active Australia Survey), quality of life (RAND 36), and body mass index (BMI) were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months. Website usage was measured continuously. Analyses of covariance were used to assess change over time in continuous outcome measures. Multiple imputation was used to deal with missing data. Results: A total of 1328 participants completed baseline assessments. Only 3-month outcomes (224 completers) were analyzed due to high attrition at 12 months (77 completers). Web 2.0 group participants increased physical activity by 92.8 minutes per week more than those in the Web 1.0 group (95\% CI 28.8-156.8; P=.005); their BMI values also decreased more (-1.03 kg/m2, 95\% CI -1.65 to -0.41; P=.001). For quality of life, only the physical functioning domain score significantly improved more in the Web 2.0 group (3.6, 95\% CI 1.7-5.5; P{\textless}.001). The time between the first and last visit to the website (3.57 vs 2.22 weeks; P{\textless}.001) and the mean number of days the website was visited (9.02 vs 5.71 days; P=.002) were significantly greater in the Web 2.0 group compared to the Web 1.0 group. The difference in time-to-nonusage attrition was not statistically significant between groups (Hazard Ratio=0.97, 95\% CI 0.86-1.09; P=.59). Only 21.99\% (292/1328) of participants (n=292 summed for both groups) were still using either website after 2 weeks and 6.55\% (87/1328) were using either website after 10 weeks. Conclusions: The website that provided more interactive and social features was more effective in improving physical activity in real-world conditions. While the Web 2.0 website was visited significantly more, both groups nevertheless displayed high nonusage attrition and low intervention engagement. More research is needed to examine the external validity and generalizability of Web-based physical activity interventions.},

Objectives: Initiation of tobacco, alcohol and illicit substance use typically occurs during adolescence, with the school setting recommended to reduce adolescent substance use. Strengthening individual (eg, problem solving) and environmental (eg, caring relationships at school) resilience protective factors of adolescents has been suggested as a strategy for reducing substance use by adolescents; however, few studies have examined this potential. A study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of a pragmatic school-based universal 'resilience' intervention in reducing the prevalence of tobacco, alcohol and illicit substance use, and increasing the individual and environmental protective factors of students. Design: A cluster-randomised controlled trial. Setting: Thirty-two Australian secondary schools (20 intervention; 12 control). Participants: Cohort of grade 7 students followed-up in grade 10 (2014; aged 15-16 years). Intervention: A pragmatic intervention involving school staff selection and implementation of available programmes and resources targeting individual and environmental 'resilience' protective factors for all grade 7-10 students was implemented in schools (2012-2014). School staff were provided implementation support. Measurements: An online survey collected baseline and follow-up data for primary outcomes: tobacco (ever, recent) and alcohol (ever, recent, 'risk') use, and secondary outcomes: marijuana and other illicit substance use, and individual (six-factor subscales, aggregate) and environmental (three-factor subscales, aggregate) protective factor scores. Generalised and linear mixed models examined follow-up differences between groups. Results: Follow-up data from 2105 students (intervention=1261; control=844; 69\% of baseline cohort) were analysed. No significant differences were found between intervention and control students for any primary (ever tobacco: OR 1.25, 95\% CI 0.92 to 1.68, p=0.14; recent tobacco: OR 1.39, 95\% CI 0.84 to 2.31, p=0.19; recent ever alcohol: OR 1.11, 95\% CI 0.83 to 1.48, p=0.46; alcohol: OR 1.13, 95\% CI 0.78 to 1.62, p=0.51; 'risk' alcohol: OR 0.98, 95\% CI 0.70 to 1.36, p=0.89) or secondary outcomes (marijuana: OR 1.12, 95\% CI 0.74 to 1.68, p=0.57; other illicit substance: OR 1.19, 95\% CI 0.67 to 2.10, p=0.54; individual protective factors: MD=0, 95\% CI -0.07 to 0.06, p=0.89; environmental protective factors: MD: -0.02, 95\% CI -0.09 to 0.06, p=0.65). Conclusions: The universally implemented pragmatic school-based intervention was not effective in reducing the prevalence of tobacco, alcohol or illicit substance use, or in increasing the protective factors of students.},

Strategies aimed at strengthening resilience protective factors provide a potential approach for reducing mental health problems in adolescents. This study evaluated the effectiveness of a universal, school-based intervention targeting resilience protective factors in reducing mental health problems in adolescents. A cluster randomised controlled trial was conducted in 20 intervention and 12 control secondary schools located in socio-economically disadvantaged areas of NSW, Australia. Data were collected from 3115 students at baseline (Grade 7, 2011), of whom 2149 provided data at follow up (Grade 10, 2014; enrolments in Grades 7 to 10 typically aged 12–16 years; 50\% male; 69.0\% retention). There were no significant differences between groups at follow-up for three mental health outcomes: total SDQ, internalising problems, and prosocial behaviour. A small statistically significant difference in favour of the control group was found for externalising problems.

This article describes the protocol and statistical analysis plan. Method: These trials are parallel randomised controlled trials that investigate and compare the effect of a telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle intervention for improving pain intensity in overweight or obese patients with low back pain or knee osteoarthritis. The analysis plan was finalised prior to initiation of analyses. All data collected as part of the trial were reviewed,without stratification by group,and classified by baseline characteristics,process of care and trial outcomes. Trial outcomes were classified as primary and secondary outcomes. Appropriate descriptive statistics and statistical testing of between-group differences,where relevant,have been planned and described. Conclusions: A protocol for standard analyses was developed for the results of two randomised controlled trials. This protocol describes the data,and the pre-determined statistical tests of relevant outcome measures. The plan demonstrates transparent and verifiable use of the data collected. This a priori protocol will be followed to ensure rigorous standards of data analysis are strictly adhered to.},

  abstract = {© 2017 The Author(s). Background: Despite clinical practice guidelines recommending the routine provision of nicotine dependence treatment to smokers in inpatient psychiatric facilities, the prevalence of such treatment provision is low. The aim of this study was to examine the effectiveness of a clinical practice change intervention in increasing clinician recorded provision of nicotine dependence treatment to patients in inpatient psychiatric facilities. Methods: We undertook an interrupted time series analysis of nicotine dependence treatment provision before, during and after a clinical practice change intervention to increase clinician recorded provision of nicotine dependence treatment for all hospital discharges (aged {\textgreater}18 years, N = 4175) over a 19 month period in two inpatient adult psychiatric facilities in New South Wales, Australia. The clinical practice change intervention comprised six key strategies: leadership and consensus, enabling systems and procedures, training and education, information and resources, audit and feedback and an on-site practice change support officer. Systematic medical record audit and segmented logistic regression was used to determine differences in proportions for each nicotine dependence treatment outcome measure between the 'pre', 'during' and 'post-intervention' periods. Results: The prevalence of all five outcome measures increased significantly between the pre and post-intervention periods, including clinician recorded: assessment of patient smoking status (36.43 to 51.95\%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.39, 99\% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.23 to 4.66); assessment of patient nicotine dependence status (4.74 to 11.04\%; AOR = 109.67, 99\% CI: 35.35 to 340.22); provision of brief advice to quit (0.85 to 8.81\%; AOR = 97.43, 99\% CI: 31.03 to 306.30); provision of nicotine replacement therapy (8.06 to 26.25\%; AOR = 19.59, 99\% CI: 8.17 to 46.94); and provision of nicotine dependence treatment on discharge (8.82 to 13.45\%, AOR = 12.36; 99\% CI: 6.08 to 25.14). Conclusions: This is the first study to provide evidence that a clinical practice change intervention may increase clinician recorded provision of nicotine dependence treatment in inpatient psychiatric settings. The intervention offers a mechanism for psychiatric facilities to increase the provision of nicotine dependence treatment in accordance with clinical guidelines.},

This study aimed to determine whether patients with heroin dependence dispensed buprenorphine-naloxone weekly have greater reductions in heroin use and related adverse health effects 12-weeks after commencing treatment, compared to waitlist controls and to examine the cost-effectiveness of this strategy. Methods An open-label waitlist RCT was conducted in an opioid treatment clinic in Newcastle, Australia. Fifty patients with DSM-IV-TR heroin dependence (and no other substance dependence) were recruited. The intervention group (n = 25) received take-home self-administered sublingual buprenorphine-naloxone weekly (mean dose, 22.7 ± 5.7 mg) and weekly clinical review. Waitlist controls (n = 25) received no clinical intervention. The primary outcome was heroin use (self-report, urine toxicology verified) at weeks four, eight and 12. The primary cost-effectiveness outcome was incremental cost per additional heroin-free-day. Results Outcome data were available for 80\% of all randomized participants. Across the 12-weeks, treatment group heroin use was on average 19.02 days less/month (95\% CI −22.98, −15.06, p {\textless} 0.0001). A total 12-week reduction in adjusted costs including crime of \$A5,722 (95\% CI 3299, 8154) in favor of treatment was observed. Excluding crime, incremental cost per heroin-free-day gained from treatment was \$A18.24 (95\% CI 4.50, 28.49). Conclusion When compared to remaining on a waitlist, take-home self-administered buprenorphine-naloxone treatment is associated with significant reductions in heroin use for people with DSM-IV-TR heroin dependence. This cost-effective approach may be an efficient strategy to enhance treatment capacity.},

  abstract = {© 2019 Society for the Study of Addiction Aim: Aims were to test the effectiveness of an organizational change intervention integrating smoking cessation treatment into usual alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment, compared with usual care, on (1) 7-day point prevalence abstinence (PPA) at 8 weeks follow-up; (2) prolonged abstinence; (3) cigarettes smoked per day; (4) number of quit attempts; and (5) offer and use of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). All outcomes were assessed at 8 weeks and 6.5 months follow-up. Design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial, with AOD service as unit of randomization, conducted January 2015–March 2016. Setting: Thirty-two eligible services (provided face-to-face client sessions to ≥ 50 clients/year) in Australia were randomized to control (usual care; n = 15) or intervention (n = 17) groups by an independent blinded biostatistician. Participants: Eligible participants (≥ 16 years, current smoker) completed surveys at the service at baseline (n = 896) and telephone follow-up surveys (conducted by blinded assessors) at 8 weeks (n = 471; 53\%) and 6.5 months (n = 427; 48\%). Intervention: Intervention services received an intervention to establish routine screening, assessment and delivery of smoking cessation care. Measurements: Primary outcome was biochemically verified 7-day PPA at 8-week follow-up. Secondary outcomes included verified and self-reported prolonged abstinence, self-reported 7-day PPA, cigarettes/day, quit attempts and offer and use of NRT. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed, assuming missing participants were not abstinent. Findings: At 8 weeks, the findings in verified 7-day PPA between groups [2.6 versus 1.8\%, odds ratio (OR) = 1.72, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 0.5–5.7, P = 0.373] were inconclusive as to whether a difference was present. Significantly lower mean cigarettes/day were reported in the intervention group compared to the usual care group at 8 weeks [incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.88, 95\% CI = 0.8–0.95, P = 0.001] but were similar at 6.5 months (IRR = 0.96, 95\% CI = 0.9–1.02, P = 0.240) follow-up. At both follow-ups the intervention group reported higher rates of NRT use. Conclusions: Integrating smoking cessation treatment into addiction services did not significantly improve short-term abstinence from smoking.},

Methods: Adult survivors (18 years+) who had been diagnosed with a haematological cancer were recruited to a cross-sectional mailed survey via five state cancer registries in Australia. Participating survivors invited a support person to also complete a survey. Structural equation modelling was used to explore the relationships among survivor and support person self-reported depression, anxiety, and unmet needs. Results: Of the 4299 eligible haematological cancer survivors contacted by the registries, 1511 (35\%) returned a completed survey as did 1004 support persons. There were 787 dyads with complete data. After adjusting for age, gender, rurality, cancer type, and whether the support person was a relative, positive correlations were found between survivor and support person scores for depression (p = 0.0029) and unmet needs (p {\textless} 0.001), but not anxiety scores (p = 0.075). Survivor unmet needs were significantly related to support person depression (p = 0.0036). Support person unmet needs were significantly related to a higher depression score for survivors (p = 0.0067). Greater support person unmet needs were significantly related to a higher anxiety score for survivors (p = 0.0083). Survivor unmet needs did not have a significant relationship to support person anxiety (p = 0.78). Conclusion: Unmet needs may mediate the interdependence of psychosocial experiences for survivors and support persons, although a longitudinal study is required to confirm causality. Addressing unmet needs may be a potential target for improving outcomes for both groups.},

  abstract = {The 3′ UTRs of eukaryotic genes participate in a variety of post-transcriptional (and some transcriptional) regulatory interactions. Some of these interactions are well characterised, but an undetermined number remain to be discovered. While some regulatory sequences in 3′ UTRs may be conserved over long evolutionary time scales, others may have only ephemeral functional significance as regulatory profiles respond to changing selective pressures. Here we propose a sensitive segmentation methodology for investigating patterns of composition and conservation in 3′ UTRs based on comparison of closely related species. We describe encodings of pairwise and three-way alignments integrating information about conservation, GC content and transition/transversion ratios and apply the method to three closely related Drosophila species: D. melanogaster, D. simulans and D. yakuba. Incorporating multiple data types greatly increased the number of segment classes identified compared to similar methods based on conservation or GC content alone. We propose that the number of segments and number of types of segment identified by the method can be used as proxies for functional complexity. Our main finding is that the number of segments and segment classes identified in 3′ UTRs is greater than in the same length of protein-coding sequence, suggesting greater functional complexity in 3′ UTRs. There is thus a need for sustained and extensive efforts by bioinformaticians to delineate functional elements in this important genomic fraction.

This study examined the prevalence of depression by level of alcohol misuse, and the sociodemographic factors associated with depression and increased alcohol misuse severity. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 3559 Australian general practice patients. Patients completed their demographic details, the Patient Health Questionnaire (9-item) and the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (Consumption items). The prevalence of alcohol misuse and depression was 6.7\%, and depression prevalence varied significantly according to level of alcohol misuse (P{\textless}0.001). Age, gender, Aboriginality and number of chronic diseases were associated with depression and higher levels of alcohol misuse. These findings may assist General Practitioners in identifying those at risk of experiencing co-morbid depression and alcohol use, and aid in effective treatment and referral.},

  abstract = {© 2019 Dietitians Association of Australia Aim: This study aimed to explore clustering among individual eating behaviours in a sample of Australian university students, and explore associations between clustered eating behaviours and demographic characteristics. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of data from the University of Newcastle (UON) Student Healthy Lifestyle Survey 2017 was conducted. Measures included eating behaviours (eg, vegetables, energy-dense nutrient poor [EDNP] food intakes) assessed using short diet questions, and demographic characteristics (eg, age, undergraduate/postgraduate student). Factor analysis was used to explore clustering of individual eating behaviours (ie, identify factors). Linear regression models were used to explore associations between eating behaviour factors identified and demographic characteristics. Results: A total of 3062 students (70\% female; 56\% aged 17-24 years) were included in the analysis. The six eating behaviour factors identified (characterised by higher consumption of the named foods/drinks) were; EDNP snack foods, meat and takeaway foods, fruit and vegetables, sugary drinks, breakfast, and breads and cereals. A higher fruit and vegetable factor score was associated with being female (P {\textless}.001), and a higher meat and takeaway foods factor score was associated with being male (P {\textless}.001) and of younger age (P {\textless}.001). Conclusions: Nutrient-rich foods clustered together and EDNP foods clustered together, that is, the identified factors represent either nutrient-rich or EDNP foods. Interventions in the university setting should target students with the poorest eating behaviours, including males and younger students.},

Objectives: To determine the extent to which physical activity reduces the number of hospital bed-days for Australians over 55, using an objective measure of activity. Design, setting and participants: 9784 Newcastle residents aged 55 years or more were invited to participate. 3253 responders were eligible and wore pedometers for one week during 2005e2007; their hospital data from recruitment to 31 March 2015 were analysed (mean follow-up time: 8.2 years). Complete data for 2110 people were available for analysis. Main outcome measures: Mean annual hospital bed-days, according to individual step count. Results: There was a statistically significant reduction in the number of hospital bed-days associated with higher step counts; the incidence rate ratio per extra 1000 steps per day at baseline was 0.91 (95\% CI, 0.90e0.94). The disease-specific reductions were significant for admissions for cancer and diabetes, but not for cardiovascular disease. The difference between 4500 and 8800 steps per day (the upper and lower quartile boundaries for step count) was 0.36 bed-days per person per year, after adjusting for age, sex, number of medications, number of comorbidities, smoking and alcohol status, and education. When analysis was restricted to hospital admissions after the first 2 years of follow-up, the difference was 0.29 bed-days per person per year. Conclusions: More active people require less hospital care, and an achievable extra 4300 steps per day would result in an average of one less day in hospital for each 3 years of life.},

Introduction Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) is a novel, minimally invasive technique for obtaining lung tissue for histopathological assessment in interstitial lung disease (ILD). Despite its increasing popularity, the diagnostic accuracy of TBLC is not yet known. The COLDICE Study (Cryobiopsy versus Open Lung biopsy in the Diagnosis of Interstitial lung disease allianCE) aims to evaluate the agreement between TBLC and surgical lung biopsy sampled concurrently from the same patients, for both histopathological and multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) diagnoses. Methods and analysis This comparative, multicentre, prospective trial is enrolling patients with ILD requiring surgical lung biopsy to aid with their diagnosis. Participants are consented for both video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical (VATS) biopsy and TBLC within the same anaesthetic episode. Specimens will be blindly assessed by three expert pathologists both individually and by consensus. Each tissue sample will then be considered in conjunction with clinical and radiological data, within a centralised MDD. Each patient will be presented twice in random order, once with TBLC data and once with VATS data. Meeting participants will be blinded to the method of tissue sampling. The accuracy of TBLC will be assessed by agreement with VATS at (1) histopathological analysis and (2) MDD diagnosis. Data will be collected on interobserver agreement between pathologists, interobserver agreement between MDD participants, and detailed clinical and procedural characteristics. Ethics and dissemination The study is being conducted in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonisation Guideline for Good Clinical Practice and Australian legislation for the ethical conduct of research. Trial registration number ACTRN12615000718549.},

  abstract = {© 2019 World Stroke Organization. Background: Transient ischemic attacks are common and place patients at risk of subsequent stroke. The 2007 EXPRESS and SOS-TIA studies demonstrated the efficacy of rapid treatment initiation. We hypothesized that with these findings having informed subsequent transient ischemic attacks management protocols, transient ischemic attacks prognosis in contemporary (2008 and later) patient cohorts would be more favorable than in historical cohorts. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies and randomized control trial placebo-arms of transient ischemic attack (published 2008–2015). The primary outcome was stroke. Secondary outcomes were mortality, transient ischemic attack, and myocardial infarction. Studies were excluded if the outcome of transient ischemic attack patients was not reported separately. The systematic review included all studies of transient ischemic attack. The meta-analysis excluded studies of restricted transient ischemic attack patient types (e.g. only patients with atrial fibrillation). The pooled cumulative risks of stroke recurrence were estimated from study-specific estimates at 2, 7, 30, and 90 days post-transient ischemic attack, using a multivariate Bayesian model. Results: We included 47 studies in the systematic review and 40 studies in the meta-analysis. In the systematic review (191,202 patients), stroke at 2 days was reported in 13/47 (27.7\%) of studies, at 7 days in 20/47 (42.6\%), at 30 days in 12/47 (25.5\%), and at 90 days in 33/47 (70.2\%). Studies included in the meta-analysis recruited 68,563 patients. The cumulative risk of stroke was 1.2\% (95\% credible interval (CI) 0.6–2.2), 3.4\% (95\% CI 2.0–5.5), 5.0\% (95\% CI 2.9–8.9), and 7.4\% (95\% CI 4.3–12.4) at 2, 7, 30, and 90 days post-transient ischemic attack, respectively. Conclusion: In contemporary settings, transient ischemic attack prognosis is more favorable than reported in historical cohorts where a meta-analysis suggests stroke risk of 3.1\% at two days.},

The influence of the quantity of F/V consumed on skin yellowness and plasma carotenoid concentrations has not been examined previously. Objective To compare the influence of consuming high-carotenoid-containing F/V (HCFV) (176,425 μg beta carotene/wk) vs low-carotenoid F/V (LCFV) (2,073 μg beta carotene/wk) on skin yellowness and plasma carotenoid concentrations, over 4 weeks. Design and intervention A single-blind randomized controlled crossover trial from October 2013 to March 2014. Thirty women were randomized to receive 7 daily servings of HCFV or LCFV for 4 weeks. Following a 2-week washout period they followed the alternate intervention. Main outcome measures Skin color (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage L*a*b* color space, where L* represents skin lightness and positive values of a* and b* represent degrees of redness and yellowness, respectively) was assessed by reflectance spectroscopy in both sun-exposed and nonexposed skin areas. Fasting plasma carotenoids were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography, before and after each intervention period. Statistical analyses performed Linear mixed models were used to determine the HCFV and LCFV response on skin color and plasma carotenoids, adjusting for intervention order, time, and interaction between baseline differences and time. Results There were no significant differences in mean daily fruit (P=0.42) and vegetable (P=0.17) intakes between HCFV and LCFV groups. Dietary alpha carotene, beta carotene, lutein, and beta cryptoxanthin intakes were significantly different between the two groups (P{\textless}0.01). Following HCFV there was a significantly greater increase in skin yellowness (b*) in both sun-exposed (P{\textless}0.001) and unexposed areas, (P{\textless}0.001), with no change in skin lightness (L*) or redness (a*). Significantly higher plasma alpha carotene (P=0.004), beta carotene (P=0.001), and lutein (P=0.028) concentrations were found following the HCFV intervention. Skin yellowness correlated with alpha carotene and beta carotene. Conclusions Skin yellowness (b*) and fasting plasma carotenoid concentrations were significantly higher following HCFV than LCFV over 4 weeks.},

The current study aimed to determine the: (i) feasibility, (ii) acceptability, and (iii) cost per completed survey of computer tablet versus telephone data collection for clients attending an outpatient drug and alcohol treatment clinic. Design Two-arm randomised controlled trial. Method Clients attending a drug and alcohol outpatient clinic in New South Wales, Australia, were randomised to complete a baseline survey via computer tablet in the clinic or via telephone interview within two weeks of their appointment. All participants completed a three-month follow-up survey via telephone. Results Consent and completion rates for the baseline survey were significantly higher in the computer tablet condition. The time taken to complete the computer tablet survey was lower (11 min) than the telephone condition (17 min). There were no differences in the proportion of consenters or completed follow-up surveys between the two conditions at the 3-month follow-up. Acceptability was high across both modes of data collection. The cost of the computer tablet condition was \$67.52 greater per completed survey than the telephone condition. Conclusion There is a trade-off between computer tablet and telephone data collection. While both data collection methods were acceptable to participants, the computer tablet condition resulted in higher consent and completion rates at baseline, therefore yielding greater external validity, and was quicker for participants to complete. Telephone data collection was however, more cost-effective. Researchers should carefully consider the mode of data collection that suits individual study needs.},

Design: Baseline data were collected prior to seeking consent for the Call it Quits, a randomised controlled trial. Setting: An Australian social and community service organisation. Sociodemographic, smoking and psychosocial characteristics were compared between smokers who agreed or declined to participate. Participants: Of the 584 smokers invited to participate, 431 (74\%) consented and 153 (26\%) declined. Results: Logistic regression modelling indicates the ORs of participation were twice as high for those reporting 'high' motivation to quit compared to the 'moderate' motivation group, and five times higher than the 'low' motivation group ( p=0.007). The ORs of consenting were higher for those with a preference for gradual reduction in cigarettes in quit attempts compared with 'no preference'. The ORs were lower for those reporting 'don't know' regarding their enjoyment of smoking compared to 'not at all' enjoying smoking, and reporting that fewer of their family or friends smoked compared to 'most or all'. Conclusions: This study is the first to examine the characteristics of socially disadvantaged smokers who consent or decline to participate in a smoking cessation trial. Low-income smokers who are motivated to quit, are not enjoying smoking, had family or friends who smoked, and who are interested in gradual cessation approaches may be more likely to participate in a smoking cessation trial.},

This study aimed to determine the accuracy of general practitioner identification of depression and alcohol misuse. Participants from 12 Australian general practices reported demographic and health risk behaviour data. General practitioners were asked to indicate the presence or absence of six health risk factors for individual patients. Accuracy of general practitioner identification was low at 21 per cent. Those with severe alcohol misuse, no chronic diseases and lower education levels were more likely to be identified. Routine screening prior to patient appointments may be a simple and efficient way to increase identification rates.},

  abstract = {© 2020 The Authors. Published on behalf of the American Heart Association, Inc., by Wiley. Background: Intravenous thrombolytic therapy (IVT) with tissue plasminogen activator for acute ischemic stroke is underutilized in many parts of the world. Randomized trials to test the effectiveness of thrombolysis implementation strategies are limited. Methods and Results: This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a multicomponent, multidisciplinary tissue plasminogen activator implementation package in increasing the proportion of thrombolyzed cases while maintaining accepted benchmarks for low rates of intracranial hemorrhage and high rates of functional outcomes at 3 months. A cluster randomized controlled trial of 20 hospitals in the early stages of thrombolysis implementation across 3 Australian states was undertaken. Monitoring of IVT rates during the baseline period allowed hospitals (the unit of randomization) to be grouped into 3 baseline IVT strata—very low rates (0\% to ≤4.0\%); low rates ({\textgreater}4.0\% to ≤10.0\%); and moderate rates ({\textgreater}10.0\%). Hospitals were randomized to an implementation package (experimental group) or usual care (control group) using a 1:1 ratio. The 16-month intervention was based on behavioral theory and analysis of the steps, roles, and barriers to rapid assessment for thrombolysis eligibility and involved comprehensive strategies addressing individual and system-level change. The primary outcome was the difference in tissue plasminogen activator proportions between the 2 groups postintervention. The absolute difference in postintervention IVT rates between intervention and control hospitals adjusted for baseline IVT rate and stratum was not significant (primary outcome rate difference=1.1\% (95\% CI −1.5\% to 3.7\%; P=0.38). Rates of intracranial hemorrhage remained below international benchmarks. Conclusions: The implementation package resulted in no significant change in tissue plasminogen activator implementation, suggesting that ongoing support is needed to sustain initial modifications in behavior.

  abstract = {© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Introduction: School canteens are the most frequently accessed take-away food outlet by Australian children. The rapid development of online lunch ordering systems for school canteens presents new opportunities to deliver novel public health nutrition interventions to school-aged children. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a behavioural intervention in reducing the energy, saturated fat, sugar and sodium content of online canteen lunch orders for primary school children. Methods and analysis: The study will employ a cluster randomised controlled trial design. Twenty-six primary schools in New South Wales, Australia, that have an existing online canteen ordering system will be randomised to receive either a multi-strategy behavioural intervention or a control (the standard online canteen ordering system). The intervention will be integrated into the existing online canteen system and will seek to encourage the purchase of healthier food and drinks for school lunch orders (ie, items lower in energy, saturated fat, sugar and sodium). The behavioural intervention will use evidence-based choice architecture strategies to redesign the online menu and ordering system including: menu labelling, placement, prompting and provision of feedback and incentives. The primary trial outcomes will be the mean energy (kilojoules), saturated fat (grams), sugar (grams) and sodium (milligrams) content of lunch orders placed via the online system, and will be assessed 12 months after baseline data collection. Ethics and dissemination: The study was approved by the ethics committees of the University of Newcastle (H-2017-0402) and the New South Wales Department of Education and Communities (SERAP 2018065), and the Catholic Education Office Dioceses of Sydney, Parramatta, Lismore, Maitland-Newcastle, Bathurst, Canberra-Goulburn, Wollongong, Wagga Wagga and Wilcannia-Forbes. Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, reports, presentations at relevant national and international conferences and via briefings to key stakeholders. Results will be used to inform future implementation of public health nutrition interventions through school canteens, and may be transferable to other food settings or online systems for ordering food.},

  abstract = {© 2016 The Author(s). Background: The implementation of nutrition policies in schools has been recommended as a strategy to improve child dietary intake. Internationally, research suggests that the majority of schools do not implement these policies. In New South Wales (NSW), Australia, the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy requires that school canteens prohibit the sale of 'red' foods (i.e. foods that are typically nutrient poor and high in energy, such as confectionary and deep-fried foods) and 'banned'drinks (i.e. soft drinks); and that the majority of items on the menu are 'green' (i.e. foods that are good sources of nutrients, such fruits, vegetables and lean meats). This study examined the impact of a multicomponent audit and feedback intervention on schools' implementation of the NSW Healthy School Canteen Policy. A secondary aim was to assess the impact of the intervention on menu composition. Methods: This study was a parallel group randomised controlled trial with 72 rural and remote primary schools (36 interventions, 36 controls) located in one region within NSW, Australia. Intervention schools received an initial face to face contact and up to four cycles of audit and feedback (consisting of a menu audit, written feedback report and telephone feedback) over a 12-month period. The primary trial outcomes were the proportion of schools with a canteen menu that had: i) no 'red' foods or 'banned' drinks; and ii) {\textgreater}50\% 'green' items, as assessed via standardised menu audits undertaken by trained dietitians. For each primary outcome, between-group differences were assessed using Fisher's exact test under an intention to treat approach. Results: There was insufficient evidence to conclude the intervention had a positive impact on the proportion of intervention schools with no 'red' or 'banned' items on their menu (RR = 2.8; 95\% CI: 0.9 to 8.9; p = 0.0895), or on the proportion of intervention schools with more than 50\% 'green' items (RR = 1.5; 95\% CI: 0.7 to 3.2; p = 0.2568). These findings remained non-significant in the multiple imputation analyses. Intervention schools were significantly more likely to have a lower percentage of 'red' items (p-value: 0.007) and a higher percentage of 'green' items on the menu (p-value: 0.014). This remained statistically significant in the multiple imputation analyses for 'red items' (p-value: 0.0081) but not for 'green' items (p-value: 0.0910). Conclusions: While there was insufficient statistical evidence to suggest that this multicomponent audit and feedback intervention was effective in improving primary schools' compliance with a healthy canteen policy, the intervention demonstrated some positive impact in reducing the availability of 'red' items on the menu. Trial registration: This trial was prospectively registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12613000543785 ). Registered 15th May 2013.},

  abstract = {© 2017 The Authors Background Depression is common among those experiencing alcohol and other drug (AOD) disorders. It has been suggested that identifying depressive symptoms among this group is important for case management. Despite this, there is a lack of research examining how well clinicians perform this task within this setting. Aims To determine the: (i) accuracy of clinician identified elevated symptoms of depression among clients seeking treatment for AOD misuse as compared to a standardized self-report psychiatric screening tool; and (ii) clinician and client characteristics associated with accurate identification of elevated symptoms of depression. Methods The study used a descriptive cohort design. Participants from two Australian AOD outpatient clinics reported demographic data and completed the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to identify elevated symptoms of depression. Clinicians were asked to indicate the presence or absence of depression for individual clients. Client and clinician data were compared. Results Sensitivity of clinician identified elevated symptoms of depression, compared with the PHQ-9, was moderate at 73.0\% (95\% CI = 63.7, 81.0) and specificity was low with 49.5\% (95\% CI = 39.9, 61.2) accurately identified as not having elevated symptoms of depression. AOD clinicians’ years’ of experience, clients’ main substance and length of treatment were associated with accuracy of identification. Conclusion Clinicians identify elevated symptoms of depression with moderate accuracy amongst individuals with AOD disorders. There is a tendency to over-identify which may contribute to inaccuracies. Routine screening may assist in improving identification of depressive symptoms and place greater focus on mental health comorbidities.},

The objective of this study was to determine the concordance between data extracted from two Clinical Decision Support Systems regarding diabetes testing and monitoring at Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services in Australia. De-identified PenCAT and Communicare Systems data were extracted from the services allocated to the intervention arm of a diabetes care trial, and intra-class correlations for each extracted item were derived at a service level. Strong to very strong correlations between the two data sources were found regarding the total number of patients with diabetes per service (Intra-class correlation [ICC] = 0.99), as well as the number (ICC = 0.98-0.99) and proportion (ICC = 0.96) of patients with diabetes by gender. The correlation was moderate for the number and proportion of Type 2 diabetes patients per service in the group aged 18-34 years (ICC = 0.65 and 0.8-0.82 respectively). Strong to very strong correlations were found for numbers and proportions of patients being tested for diabetes, and for appropriate monitoring of patients known to have diabetes (ICC = 0.998-1.00). This indicated a generally high degree of concordance between whole-service data extracted by the two Clinical Decision Support Systems. Therefore, the less expensive or less complex option (depending on the individual circumstances of the service) may be appropriate for monitoring diabetes testing and care. However, the extraction of data about subgroups of patients may not be interchangeable.},

The origins of CVD may commence during pregnancy, yet few serum reference values for CVD biomarkers exist specific to the pregnancy period. The Gomeroi gaaynggal research project is a program that undertakes research and provides some health services to pregnant Indigenous women. Three hundred and ninety-nine non-fasting samples provided by the study participants (206 pregnancies and 175 women) have been used to construct reference intervals for CVD biomarkers during this critical time. A pragmatic design was used, in that women were not excluded for the presence of chronic or acute health states. Percentile bands for non-linear relationships were constructed according to the methods of Wright and Royston (2008), using the xriml package in StataIC 13.1. Serum cholesterol, triglycerides, cystatin-C and alkaline phosphatase increased as gestational age progressed, with little change seen in high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein and γ glutamyl transferase. Values provided in the reference intervals are consistent with findings from other research projects. These reference intervals will form a basis with which future CVD biomarkers for pregnant Indigenous Australian women can be compared.},

Mothers are more likely than fathers to engage with services and have their mental health monitored and attended to during the perinatal period. The present study aimed to explore whether smartphone technology could be used to address fathers' needs across their transition to fatherhood. Methods: A corpus of messages, including linked information and mood tracking software, was designed to support and enhance paternal relationships with their babies, their partners and themselves across the perinatal period. Messages were sent to project participants (N = 520) from 12-weeks' gestation to 24-weeks after birth. Results: Of those fathers enrolled (N = 520), 21.5\% scored {\textgreater}13 on K6 and completion rate (85\%) was similar between these and other fathers. Most fathers (63.1\%) clicked at least one link and responses were received for 20.5\% of mood tracker questions. The probability of reporting worse mood scores decreased over time. Fathers completing post study surveys (N = 101) reported that messages helped them in their experience of becoming a new dad (92.8\%), as well as helping them develop a strong relationship with their new child (54.9\%), and in their relationship with their partner (79\%). Conclusions: The present study has demonstrated that it is both feasible and acceptable to support new fathers with SMS4dads, a relationship-focused messaging system designed to be delivered to smartphones across fathers' transition to parenthood.},

This study analysed how often clinicians ask pregnant women about their use of e-cigarettes, cannabis, chewing tobacco, and second-hand smoke (SHS) exposure. Two cross-sectional surveys were undertaken. A random sample of 500 General Practitioner (GP) members were invited from the National Faculty of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health (NFATSIH) to complete an on-line survey, and 5571 GP and Obstetrician (OBS) members of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG) were sent a paper survey by mail. Questions on frequency of asking about the exposures used Likert Scales, later dichotomized to "often-always" and "never-sometimes". Logistic regressions estimated associations between clinician type and asking about cannabis, e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco, and SHS. An adjusted model reduced potential confounders of location, guidelines, gender and population. n = 378 GPs and OBS participated (6.2\% response). In total, 13-14\% asked "often-always" about e-cigarettes; 58\% cannabis; 38\% cannabis with tobacco; 27\% SHS, and 10\% chewing tobacco-compared to 95\% of the sample asking about cigarette smoking. After adjustment, the odds of RANZCOG GPs (OR 0.34) and OBS (OR 0.63) asking about cannabis were lower compared to NFATSIH GPs. Clinician type was non-significant for asking about e-cigarettes, chewing tobacco and SHS. Surveyed Australian GPs and obstetricians asked less frequently about e-cigarettes, chewing, SHS exposure, and cannabis, potentially missing important exposures for mother and child.},

Australian and international studies have shown that the dermatological diagnostic ability of general practitioners (GPs) is suboptimal, contributing to increased dermatology outpatient referrals. Dermatological experience in GP vocational training is thus of particular importance. We aimed to document the prevalence of skin disease presentations and the range of skin diseases encountered by GP trainees. We also sought to establish associations of GP trainee's skin disease experience, including their personal characteristics, consultation factors, and the actions arising from the consultation. Methods: This study took place in the Registrars Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study. ReCEnT is an ongoing, prospective, multi-site cohort study of Australian GP trainees' consultations. A descriptive cross-sectional analysis was performed on trainees' consultation data. Results: In total, 645 individual trainees contributed data from 84 615 consultations. Altogether, 11\% of all problems managed were skin problems. Infections, dermatitis, injury and wounds were the most common presentations. Associations of consultations for skin problems (compared with all other problems) included seeking in-consultation advice, planning patient follow up and generating learning goals. Conclusions: These findings suggest GP trainees find skin problems challenging and may indicate a need for more and better targeted undergraduate and GP trainee education.},

Animal models have consistently suggested the role of modifier genes in determining disease phenotype, yet none have been substantiated in the human population. The mouse homologue of cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36) has been proposed as a modifier of disease in the MIN mouse model of FAP. Methods: Three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); rs1049673, rs1761667 and rs1984112 in CD36, have been investigated in 275 FAP patients to determine if they were associated with age of polyposis or risk of developing disease. Results: The results revealed a substantially lower age of polyposis diagnosis for patients belonging to the severe FAP group (harbouring adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) variants in the mutation cluster region (MCR)) and high age for patients in the attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) group for SNPs rs1761667 and rs1984112. Conclusions: This study provides evidence for patients belonging to the MCR and AFAP groups harbouring specific genotypes for SNPs in CD36 to initiate screening/treatment for FAP at much earlier (MCR) and much later (AFAP) ages than the norm in today's clinical practice. The findings need to be verified in an independent FAP patient cohort.},

  abstract = {© 2016 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs Introduction and Aims: Guidelines recommend anxiolytics and hypnotics (A/H) as second-line, short-term medications. We aimed to establish prevalence and associations of A/H prescribing by Australian general practice (GP) trainees. Design and Methods: A cross-sectional analysis from a cohort study of vocational trainees from four GP Regional Training Providers during 2010–2013. General practice trainees act as independent practitioners (including for prescribing purposes) while having recourse to advice from a GP supervisor. Practice and trainee demographic data were collected as well as patient, clinical and educational data from 60 consecutive consultations of each trainee each training term. Analysis was at the level of individual problem managed, with the outcome factor being prescription of any anxiolytic or hypnotic. Results: Overall, 645 registrars (response rate 94.0\%) prescribed 68 582 medications in 69 621 consultations (with 112 890 problems managed). A/Hs were prescribed for 1.3\% of problems managed and comprised 2.2\% of all prescriptions. They were prescribed particularly for insomnia (28.2\%) or anxiety (21.8\%), but also for many ‘off-label’ indications. Significant associations of A/H prescriptions were: patient-level (greater age, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, English-speaking background, being new to the trainee but not to the practice); trainee-level (male) and consultation-level (longer duration, pre-existing problem, specialist referral not being made). Prescribing was significantly lower in one of the four Regional Training Providers. Discussion and Conclusions: GP trainees, inconsistent with most guideline recommendations, prescribe A/Hs mainly as maintenance therapy to unfamiliar and older patients. Our results suggest that changes in management approaches are needed which may be facilitated by support for psychotherapeutic training.

This trial investigated the effectiveness of a Web 2.0-based intervention on physical activity behaviour, and the impact on website usage and engagement. Methods 504 (328 women, 126 men) insufficiently active adult participants were randomly allocated to one f two web-based interventions or a paper-based Logbook group. The Web 1.0 group participated in the existing 10 000 Steps programme, while the Web 2.0 group participated in a Web 2.0-enabled physical activity intervention including user-to-user interaction through social networking capabilities. ActiGraph GT3X activity monitors were used to assess physical activity at four points across the intervention (0, 3, 12 and 18 months), and usage and engagement were assessed continuously through website usage statistics. Results Treatment groups differed significantly in trajectories of minutes/day of physical activity (p=0.0198), through a greater change at 3 months fo Web 2.0 than Web 1.0 (7.3 min/day, 95\% CI 2.4 to 12.3). In the Web 2.0 group, physical activity increased at 3 (mean change 6.8 min/day, 95\% CI 3.9 to 9.6) and 12 months (3.8 min/day, 95\% CI 0.5 to 7.0), but not 18 months. The Logbook group also increased physical activity at 3 (4.8 min/day, 95\% CI 1.8 to 7.7) and 12 months (4.9 min/day, 95\% CI 0.7 to 9.1), but not 18 months. The Web 1.0 group increased physical activity at 12 months only (4.9 min/day, 95\% CI 0.5 to 9.3). The Web 2.0 group demonstrated higher levels of website engagement (p=0.3964).Conclusions In comparison to a Web 1.0 intervention, a more interactive Web 2.0 intervention, as well as the paper-based Logbook intervention, improved physicalactivity in the short term, but that effect reduced over time, despite higher levels of engagement of the Web 2.0 group.

Here we conducted a large-scale genetic association analysis of educational attainment in a sample of approximately 1.1 million individuals and identify 1,271 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs. For the SNPs taken together, we found evidence of heterogeneous effects across environments. The SNPs implicate genes involved in brain-development processes and neuron-to-neuron communication. In a separate analysis of the X chromosome, we identify 10 independent genome-wide-significant SNPs and estimate a SNP heritability of around 0.3\% in both men and women, consistent with partial dosage compensation. A joint (multi-phenotype) analysis of educational attainment and three related cognitive phenotypes generates polygenic scores that explain 11–13\% of the variance in educational attainment and 7–10\% of the variance in cognitive performance. This prediction accuracy substantially increases the utility of polygenic scores as tools in research.},

  abstract = {© 2018 Elsevier Ltd Background: The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events in human observational studies. Animal studies suggest that the phosphorylcholine epitope in the Streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall is structurally similar to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), hence PPV induces the production of antibodies that cross-react with anti-oxLDL and may cause regression of atherosclerotic plaque. We set out to determine the strength of association between PPV administration and reduction in cardiovascular events. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based cohort study of older Australians, from the Hunter Community Study, with up to 11 years of follow-up. We included participants aged ≥ 65 years at baseline (2004–2008), without a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). History of PPV administration at baseline was the main exposure of interest. “Total number of hospital bed-days with CVD primary diagnosis” was one of the main outcomes measured. Models were adjusted for age, diabetes, alcohol intake, and smoking status. Influenza vaccine was the control exposure used and fracture bed-days was the control outcome used, to investigate the potential for residual confounding. Results: 91 of the total 1074 participants (mean age = 72, male = 45\%) experienced a CVD event during follow-up. PPV (regardless of influenza vaccine) was associated with a significant reduction in CVD bed-day, (n = 863, incident rate ratio, IRR = 0.65, 95\%CI: 0.45–0.94, p = 0.02), but influenza vaccine (regardless of PPV) was not (n = 864, IRR = 0.86, 95\%CI: 0.54–1.35, p = 0.51). Furthermore, PPV adjusted for influenza vaccine remained associated with CVD bed-days (IRR = 0.64, 95\%CI: 0.43–0.96, p = 0.03) but was not associated with fracture bed-days (IRR = 0.75, 95\%CI: 0.28–2.00, p = 0.56). Conclusion: PPV demonstrated a 35\% reduction in CVD bed-days. This finding was robust to residual confounding, using a control exposure and a control outcome, eliminating the concern for healthy-user bias. A large double-blinded placebo-controlled RCT is underway to confirm our finding and to explore the proposed mechanism of action (ACTRN12615000536561).},

  abstract = {© 2018 The Author(s). Background: Depression is highly prevalent yet often poorly detected and treated among cancer patients. In light of the move towards evidence-based healthcare policy, we have developed a simple tool that can assist policy makers, organisations and researchers to logically think through the steps involved in improving patient outcomes, and to help guide decisions about where to allocate resources. Methods: The model assumes that a series of filters operate to determine outcomes and cost-effectiveness associated with depression care for cancer patients, including: detection of depression, provider response to detection, patient acceptance of treatment, and effectiveness of treatment provided. To illustrate the utility of the model, hypothetical data for baseline and four scenarios in which filter outcomes were improved by 15\% were entered into the model. Results: The model provides outcomes including: number of people successfully treated, total costs per scenario, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per scenario compared to baseline. The hypothetical data entered into the model illustrate the relative effectiveness (in terms of the number of additional incremental successes) and relative cost-effectiveness (in terms of cost per successful outcome and total cost) of making changes at each step or filter. Conclusions: The model provides a readily accessible tool to assist decision makers to think through the steps involved in improving depression outcomes for cancer patents. It provides transparent guidance about how to best allocate resources, and highlights areas where more reliable data are needed. The filter model presents an opportunity to improve on current practice by ensuring that a logical approach, which takes into account the available evidence, is applied to decision making.},

Efficient patient-centred quality improvement requires an understanding of the system-wide areas of dissatisfaction along with evidence to identify the programs which can be strategically targeted according to specific patient characteristics and preferences. This cross-sectional study reports the proportion of chronic disease outpatients selecting 23 patient-centred improvement initiatives. Using univariate tests and multivariable logistic regressions, this multi-site study also identifies initiatives differentially selected by outpatients according to clinical and demographic characteristics. A total of 475 outpatients participated (49\% response). Commonly selected initiatives included: reducing wait-times (22.3\%); convenient appointment scheduling (16.0\%); and receiving up-to-date treatment information (16.0\%). Within univariate tests, preferences for information and service accessibility initiatives were not significantly associated with specific subgroups. However, seven initiatives were preferred according to age, gender, diagnosis status, and chronic disease type within multivariate models. For example, neurology outpatients were more likely to select assistance to manage psychological symptoms when compared to oncology outpatients (OR: 2.89). Study findings suggest that system-wide programs to enhance information provision are strategic approaches to improve experiences across patient characteristics. Furthermore, a few initiatives can be targeted to specific groups and emphasized the importance of detailed scoping analyses and tailored implementation plans when designing patient-centred quality improvement programs.},

With equivalent survival outcomes between NAST and up-front surgery, the situation-specific preference-sensitive nature of the decision makes it suitable for a decision aid (DA). This study aimed to develop and evaluate a DA for this population. Methods: A DA booklet was developed according to international standards, including information about adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment, outcome probabilities, and a values clarification exercise. Eligible women, considered by investigators as candidates for NAST, were enrolled in a multi-institutional, single-arm, longitudinal study. Patient-reported outcome measure questionnaires were completed pre- and post-DA, between chemotherapy and surgery, and at 12 months. Outcomes were feasibility (percentage of eligible patients accessing the DA); acceptability to patients (percentage who would recommend it to others) and clinicians (percentage who would use the DA in routine practice); and decision-related outcomes. Results: From 77 eligible women, 59 were enrolled, of whom 47 (79.7\%; 95\% CI, 69.4-89.9) reported having read the DA; 51 completed the first post-DA questionnaire. Of these 51, 41 participants (80.4\%; 95\% CI, 69.5-91.3) found the DA useful for their decision about NAST. Of 18 responding investigators, 16 (88.9\%; 95\% CI, 74.4-103.4) indicated they would continue to use the DA in routine practice. Post-DA, decisional conflict decreased significantly (P{\textless}.01); anxiety and distress decreased significantly; and 86.3\% (95\% CI, 73.7-94.3) achieved at least as much decisional control as they desired. Conclusions: This DA was feasible and acceptable to patients and clinicians, and improvement in decision-related outcomes was demonstrated when used in combination with clinical consultations. This DA could safely be implemented into routine practice for women considering NAST for operable breast cancer.},

  abstract = {© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018. Objectives Interventions addressing the individual and environmental protective factors of adolescents are suggested to have potential for reducing adolescent substance use. While universally delivered school-based substance use prevention interventions are common, previous studies have suggested variable effectiveness by subgroups of students. An exploratory study was undertaken to examine the differential effectiveness of a universal school-based resilience intervention on adolescent substance use and protective factors according to their sociodemographic and previous substance use. Design Secondary analysis of data from a cluster-randomised controlled trial. Setting 32 Australian secondary schools. Participants Cohort of grade 7 students (n=3155) followed up in grade 10 (aged 15-16 years; 2014; n=2105). Intervention Three-year universal school-based intervention implemented by school staff that targeted a range of student resilience protective factors (2012-2014). Measurements Primary outcomes included: Tobacco (recent, number of cigarettes) and alcohol (recent, 'risk' and number of drinks) use, and secondary outcomes included: Marijuana (recent) and other illicit substance (recent) use, and aggregate individual and environmental protective factor scores. Generalised and linear mixed models examined interactions between treatment and student subgroups (gender; socioeconomic disadvantage (low/high); geographic location (major city/inner regional/outer regional-remote); and previous substance use (non-user/user)) at follow-up (36 models). Results Analysis of student follow-up data showed no differential intervention effect for any substance use or protective factor outcome for any subgroup, with the exception of one differential effect found by socioeconomic status for the outcome of mean number of cigarettes smoked by recent smokers (p=0.003). There was no evidence of an intervention effect within the low (mean difference (MD) -12.89, 95\% CI -26.00 to 0.23) or high (MD 16.36, 95\% CI -1.03 to 33.76) socioeconomic subgroups. Conclusions No evidence of an intervention effect on substance use and protective factors was found according to student subgroups defined by sociodemographic characteristics or previous substance use.},

  abstract = {© 2018 Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates remain suboptimal. Primary care practitioners are supported by clinical practice guidelines which recommend they provide routine CRC screening advice. Published research can provide evidence to improve CRC screening in primary care, however this is dependent on the type and quality of evidence being produced. This review aimed to provide a snapshot of trends in the type and design quality of research reporting CRC screening among primary care patients across three time points: 1993–1995, 2003–2005 and 2013–2015. Four databases were searched using MeSH headings and keywords. Publications in peer-reviewed journals which reported primary data on CRC screening uptake among primary care patients were eligible for inclusion. Studies meeting eligibility criteria were coded as observational or intervention. Intervention studies were further coded to indicate whether or not they met Effective Practice and Organisation of Care (EPOC) study design criteria. A total of 102 publications were included. Of these, 65 reported intervention studies and 37 reported observational studies. The proportion of each study type did not change significantly over time. The majority of intervention studies met EPOC design criteria at each time point. The majority of research in this field has focused on testing strategies to increase CRC screening in primary care patients, as compared to research describing rates of CRC screening in this population. Further research is needed to determine which effective interventions are most likely to be adopted into primary care.},

The genetic determinants of chronic inflammation remain largely unknown, and the causal role of CRP in several clinical outcomes is debated. We performed two genome-wide association studies (GWASs), on HapMap and 1000 Genomes imputed data, of circulating amounts of CRP by using data from 88 studies comprising 204,402 European individuals. Additionally, we performed in silico functional analyses and Mendelian randomization analyses with several clinical outcomes. The GWAS meta-analyses of CRP revealed 58 distinct genetic loci (p {\textless} 5 × 10−8). After adjustment for body mass index in the regression analysis, the associations at all except three loci remained. The lead variants at the distinct loci explained up to 7.0\% of the variance in circulating amounts of CRP. We identified 66 gene sets that were organized in two substantially correlated clusters, one mainly composed of immune pathways and the other characterized by metabolic pathways in the liver. Mendelian randomization analyses revealed a causal protective effect of CRP on schizophrenia and a risk-increasing effect on bipolar disorder. Our findings provide further insights into the biology of inflammation and could lead to interventions for treating inflammation and its clinical consequences.},

  abstract = {© 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes is escalating rapidly in Asian countries, with the rapid increase likely attributable to a combination of genetic and lifestyle factors. Recent research suggests that common genetic risk variants contribute minimally to the rapidly rising prevalence. Rather, recent changes in dietary patterns and physical activity may be more important. This nested case-control study assessed the association and predictive utility of type 2 diabetes lifestyle risk factors in participants from Malaysia, an understudied Asian population with comparatively high disease prevalence. The study sample comprised 4077 participants from The Malaysian Cohort project and included sub-samples from the three major ancestral groups: Malay (n = 1323), Chinese (n = 1344) and Indian (n = 1410). Association of lifestyle factors with type 2 diabetes was assessed within and across ancestral groups using logistic regression. Predictive utility was quantified and compared between groups using the Area Under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC). In predictive models including age, gender, waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity, location, family history of diabetes and average sleep duration, the AUC ranged from 0.76 to 0.85 across groups and was significantly higher in Chinese than Malays or Indians, likely reflecting anthropometric differences. This study suggests that obesity, advancing age, a family history of diabetes and living in a rural area are important drivers of the escalating prevalence of type 2 diabetes in Malaysia.},

Using recent fine-mapping methods incorporating functional annotation, gene expression, and differences in linkage disequilibrium between ethnicities, we further shed light on potential causal variants and genes at known and newly identified loci. Several of the novel genes encode proteins with predicted or established drug targets, including KCNK2 and CDK12.

  abstract = {© 2017, © The Author(s) 2017. Objective: Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is a condition associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). One mechanism that has been proposed is that the venous obstructions found in MS are due to a chronic persistent venulitis caused by the intra-cellular bacterial parasite, Chlamydophila pneumoniae (Cpn). The objective of the current study is to determine the effect of a combined antibiotic protocol (CAP) on the venous flow in MS patients as measured by a quantitative duplex ultrasound examination (QDUS). Method: A non-randomised before-after cohort study was conducted to investigate differences in blood flow volumes pre and 6-months post antibiotic treatment for Cpn infection. Flow volume data were measured by QDUS across affected and unaffected sides from multiple veins segments, including internal jugular vein (IJV) segments J2 and J3, and vertebral vein (VV), as well as global arterial blood flow (GABF). Results: 91 patients were included in the study. 64 (70\%) were found to have positive Cpn serology. There was a statistically significant post-treatment difference seen for the affected side of Cpn infected patients (mean difference = 56 mL/min, p = 0.02). There was a non-significant increase seen for the affected side of uninfected patients (mean difference = 23 mL/min, p = 0.2). The difference in these effects (34 mL/min) was not statistically significant (p = 0.3). The mean flow rate decreased in the unaffected side for both infected (−27 mL/min, p = 0.5) and uninfected patients (−69 mL/min, p = 0.01). There was a statistically significant post-treatment increase in GABF for the infected patients (mean difference = 90 mL/min, p = 0.02) and a difference of 76 mL/min for non-infected patients (p = 0.01). Conclusion: A CAP appears to improve the extra-cranial circulation in patients diagnosed with MS. This effect is statistically significant in patients with positive Cpn serology, although patients with negative Cpn serology also show some benefit, betraying a lack of specificity of this effect.},

  abstract = {© 2018 Background: Preventable maternal mortality is related to delays in recognizing the problem, transport to a facility, and receiving appropriate care on arrival. Reducing maternal mortality in low-literacy settings is particularly challenging. In the rural villages of Nepal, the maternal mortality rate is among the highest in the world; the reasons include illiteracy and lack of knowledge of the needs of pregnant women. Culturally, singing and dancing are part of Nepalese daily life and present an opportunity to transmit knowledge of antenatal care and care at birth with a view to reducing the first 2 delays. Objective: We hypothesized that health messages regarding the importance of antenatal care and skilled birth assistance would be effectively transmitted by songs in the limited literacy environment of rural Nepal. Study Design: We randomly grouped 4 rural village development committees comprising 36 villages into 2 (intervention and control) clusters. In the intervention group, local groups were invited to write song lyrics incorporating key health messages regarding antenatal care to accompany popular melodies. The groups presented their songs and dances in a festival organized and judged by the community. The winning songs were performed by the local people in a song and dance progression through the villages, houses, and fields. A wall chart with the key health messages was also provided to each household. Knowledge of household decision makers (senior men and women) was assessed before and after the intervention and at 12 months using a structured questionnaire in all households that also assessed behavior change. Results: Structured interviews were conducted at baseline, immediately postintervention in the control and intervention areas (intervention n = 735 interviews, control n = 775), and at 12 months in the intervention area only (n = 867). Knowledge scores were recorded as the number of correct items out of 36 questions at baseline and postintervention, and of 21 questions at follow-up. Postintervention, test score doubled in the intervention group from a mean of 11.60/36–22.33/36 (P {\textless}.001), with no practically significant change in the control population (17.48/36–18.26/36). Improvement was greatest among the most illiterate members of the community (6.8/36–19.8/36, P {\textless}.001). At 12 months follow-up, a majority of the participants (63.9\%) indicated that they provided information learned from the songs to their neighbors and friends, and 41.3\% reported still singing the songs from the intervention. Conclusion: The use of songs bypassed the limitations of literacy in communicating health messages that are key to improving maternal care in this low-literacy rural setting within a developing country. The improvements were maintained without further intervention for 12 months. With appropriate sociocultural adaptation to local contexts, this low-cost method of community education may be applicable to improving maternal health knowledge and behavior change in other low-resource and limited literacy settings that may lead to reductions in maternal mortality.},

There has been very little exploration of the potential contribution of the treatment clinic to these outcomes. This study explored whether there is variation among clinics in cancer patients’ psychological outcomes. Methods: Cancer outpatients were recruited from 22 medical oncology and haematology clinics in Australia. Participants completed a pen and paper survey including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), as well as sociodemographic, disease and treatment characteristics. Results: Of those eligible to participate, 4233 (82\%) consented and 2811 (81\% of consenters) returned the completed survey. There was no statistically significant variation in HADS depression scores across clinics. Some difference in anxiety scores derived from the HADS questionnaire between clinics (p = 0.03) was found with the percentage of between-clinic variation estimated to be 1.11\%. However, once all demographic, disease and treatment predictors were adjusted for there was no statistical differences between clinics (percent of between-clinic variation = 0.53\%; p = 0.1415). Conclusions: Psychological outcomes were not found to vary between clinics. Other sources of variation including patient characteristics may over-ride between-clinic variability, if it exists.},

  abstract = {© The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists 2018. Objectives: Alcohol misuse and depression are commonly co-occurring conditions. To date, no review has examined the most efficacious treatment model for psychosocial treatment of co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression. This systematic review determined the: (i) methodological quality of publications examining psychosocial treatment of co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression using a sequential, parallel or integrated treatment model; and (ii) effectiveness of each dual treatment model compared to single treatment for those with co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression. Methods: PubMed, Medline and PsycInfo databases were searched for studies which were included if they involved treatment for alcohol misuse and depression and could be classified into one of the three treatment models. Included studies were assessed using the Cochrane’s Effective Practice and Organisation of Care risk of bias criteria. Relevant study characteristics and outcomes were extracted and are presented in a narrative review format. Results: Seven studies met inclusion criteria. None were categorised as low risk on the risk of bias criteria. No studies examined a sequential model of treatment, three examined a parallel model and four examined an integrated model of dual-focussed treatment. The studies examining the parallel model and two out of four studies examining the effectiveness of an integrated model demonstrated greater improvement for alcohol or depression outcomes compared to control conditions. Conclusion: Evidence for the psychosocial treatment of co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression is limited to a handful of studies. The evidence has several methodological limitations, which impact the interpretation of the findings. Therefore, while international guidelines recommend integrated dual-focussed treatment for co-occurring conditions, there is little evidence supporting the superiority of this treatment format for co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression. High-quality research demonstrating improvements in patient outcomes is required to ensure recommendations for clinical practice are based on strong empirical evidence.},

Australian preventative health guidelines recommend that general practitioners (GPs) assess and provide evidence-based intervention. No studies, however, have examined the accuracy of GP detection of concurrent tobacco use and risky alcohol consumption or the factors associated with accurate detection. This study aimed to examine the: (i) accuracy of GP detection of concurrent tobacco and risky alcohol use compared to patient self-report and (ii) GP and patient characteristics associated with accurate detection following a single clinical encounter. Patients attending 12 Australian general practices completed a survey assessing smoking and alcohol consumption. For each participating patient, GPs completed a checklist to indicate the presence of these risk factors. GP judgements were compared to patient self-report. Fifty-one GPs completed a health risk checklist for 1332 patients. Only 23\% of patients who self-reported concurrent tobacco and risky alcohol use identified by their GP. Patients who visited their GP four to six times in the last year were most likely to have concurrent tobacco and risky alcohol use were identified. It is imperative to establish systems to increase detection of preventative health risks in general practice to enable the provision of evidence-based treatments.},

  abstract = {© 2018 Elsevier B.V. Background: Many factors contribute to exceptional longevity, with genetics playing a significant role. However, to date, genetic studies examining exceptional longevity have been inconclusive. This comprehensive review seeks to determine the genetic variants associated with exceptional longevity by undertaking meta-analyses. Methods: Meta-analyses of genetic polymorphisms previously associated with exceptional longevity (85+) were undertaken. For each variant, meta-analyses were performed if there were data from at least three independent studies available, including two unpublished additional cohorts. Results: Five polymorphisms, ACE rs4340, APOE ε2/3/4, FOXO3A rs2802292, KLOTHO KL-VS and IL6 rs1800795 were significantly associated with exceptional longevity, with the pooled effect sizes (odds ratios) ranging from 0.42 (APOE ε4) to 1.45 (FOXO3A males). Conclusion: In general, the observed modest effect sizes of the significant variants suggest many genes of small influence play a role in exceptional longevity, which is consistent with results for other polygenic traits. Our results also suggest that genes related to cardiovascular health may be implicated in exceptional longevity. Future studies should examine the roles of gender and ethnicity and carefully consider study design, including the selection of appropriate controls.},

  abstract = {© 2017 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs Introduction and Aims: This study aimed to compare current and ex-smokers' sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics, use of cessation aids and abrupt versus gradual quitting approaches. Design and Methods: A cross-sectional survey of financially disadvantaged adults attending a community service organisation was conducted in New South Wales, Australia, between February 2012 and December 2013. Sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, use of cessation aids and gradual versus abrupt quit approach were assessed. χ2 tests and logistic regression compared characteristics of current and ex-smokers. Results: Of 905 individuals who completed the survey, 639 (71\%) were current smokers and 107 (12\%) were ex-smokers. Ex-smokers were older [odds ratio (OR) = 1.03, 95\% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01, 1.05], had higher odds of being female (OR = 1.67, 95\% CI = 1.06, 2.65), lower odds of being financially stressed (OR = 0.87, 95\% CI = 0.76, 0.99), lower odds of anxiety and depression symptoms (OR = 0.91, 95\% CI = 0.84, 0.98) and lower odds of having friends and family who were smokers (ORs ranged from 0.30–0.43). Ex-smokers had lower odds of using cessation aids and higher odds of reporting abrupt quitting during their last quit attempt (OR = 4.48, 95\% CI = 2.66, 7.54). Conclusions: Lower levels of disadvantage, less smoking in social networks, less use of cessation aids and abrupt (vs. gradual) quitting approaches were associated with being an ex-smoker. Lower use of evidence based methods to quit by disadvantaged ex-smokers requires further exploration. [Twyman L, Bonevski B, Paul C, Bryant J, West R, Siahpush M, D'este C, Oldmeadow C, Palazzi K.

Controversy exists on whether fetal growth is normally different in different populations. Objective: We sought to determine the relationships of birthweight, birthweight percentiles, and smoking with perinatal outcomes in indigenous vs nonindigenous infants to determine whether the White infant growth charts could be applied to indigenous infants. Study Design: Data were analyzed for indigenous status, maternal age and smoking, and perinatal outcomes in 45,754 singleton liveborn infants of at least 20 weeks gestation or 400 g birthweight delivered in New South Wales, Australia, between June 2010 and July 2015. Results: Indigenous infants (n=6372; 14\%) had a mean birthweight 67 g lower than nonindigenous infants (P{\textless}.0001; with adjustment for infant sex and maternal body mass index). Indigenous mean birthweight percentile was 4.2 units lower (P{\textless}.0001). Adjustment for maternal age, smoking, body mass index, and infant sex reduced the difference in birthweight/percentiles to nonsignificance (12 g; P=.07). Conclusion: Disparities exist between indigenous and non-indigenous Australian infants for birthweight, birthweight percentile, and adverse outcome rates. Adjustment for smoking and maternal age removed any significant difference in birthweights and birthweight percentiles for indigenous infants. Our data indicate that birthweight percentiles should not be adjusted for indigenous ethnicity because this normalizes disadvantage; because White and indigenous Australians have diverged for approximately 50,000 years, it is likely that the same conclusions apply to other ethnic groups. The disparities in birthweight percentiles that are associated with smoking will likely perpetuate indigenous disadvantage into the future because low birthweight is linked to the development of chronic noncommunicable disease and poorer educational attainment; similar problems may affect other indigenous populations.},

In a combined sample of over 1 million individuals, we conducted genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of general risk tolerance, adventurousness, and risky behaviors in the driving, drinking, smoking, and sexual domains. Across all GWAS, we identified hundreds of associated loci, including 99 loci associated with general risk tolerance. We report evidence of substantial shared genetic influences across risk tolerance and the risky behaviors: 46 of the 99 general risk tolerance loci contain a lead SNP for at least one of our other GWAS, and general risk tolerance is genetically correlated (∣r̂ g∣ {\textasciitilde} 0.25 to 0.50) with a range of risky behaviors. Bioinformatics analyses imply that genes near SNPs associated with general risk tolerance are highly expressed in brain tissues and point to a role for glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission. We found no evidence of enrichment for genes previously hypothesized to relate to risk tolerance.},

  abstract = {© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Background: The optimal duration of androgen suppression for men with locally advanced prostate cancer receiving radiotherapy with curative intent is yet to be defined. Zoledronic acid is effective in preventing androgen suppression-induced bone loss, but its role in preventing castration-sensitive bone metastases in locally advanced prostate cancer is unclear. The RADAR trial assessed whether the addition of 12 months of adjuvant androgen suppression, 18 months of zoledronic acid, or both, can improve outcomes in men with locally advanced prostate cancer who receive 6 months of androgen suppression and prostatic radiotherapy. This report presents 10-year outcomes from this trial. Methods: For this randomised, phase 3, 2 × 2 factorial trial, eligible men were 18 years or older with locally advanced prostate cancer (either T2b-4, N0 M0 tumours or T2a, N0 M0 tumours provided Gleason score was ≥7 and baseline prostate-specific antigen [PSA] concentration was ≥10 μg/L). We randomly allocated participants in a 2 × 2 factorial design by computer-generated randomisation (using the minimisation technique, and stratified by centre, baseline PSA concentration, clinical tumour stage, Gleason score, and use of a brachytherapy boost) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to four treatment groups. Patients in the control group received 6 months of neoadjuvant androgen suppression with leuprorelin (22·5 mg every 3 months, intramuscularly) and radiotherapy alone (short-term androgen suppression [STAS]); this treatment was either followed by another 12 months of adjuvant androgen suppression with leuprorelin (22·5 mg every 3 months, intramuscularly; intermediate-term androgen suppression [ITAS]), or accompanied by 18 months of zoledronic acid (4 mg every 3 months, intravenously) starting at randomisation (STAS plus zoledronic acid), or both (ITAS plus zoledronic acid). All patients received radiotherapy to the prostate and seminal vesicles, starting from the end of the fifth month of androgen suppression; dosing options were 66, 70, and 74 Gy in 2-Gy fractions per day, or 46 Gy in 2-Gy fractions followed by a high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost dose of 19·5 Gy in 6·5-Gy fractions. Treatment allocation was open label. The primary endpoint was prostate cancer-specific mortality and was analysed according to intention-to-treat using competing-risks methods. The trial is closed to follow-up and this is the final report of the main endpoints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00193856. Findings: Between Oct 20, 2003, and Aug 15, 2007, 1071 men were enrolled and randomly assigned to STAS (n=268), ITAS (n=268), STAS plus zoledronic acid (n=268), and ITAS plus zoledronic acid (n=267). Median follow-up was 10·4 years (IQR 7·9–11·7). At this 10-year follow-up, no interactions were observed between androgen suppression and zoledronic acid so the treatment groups were collapsed to compare treatments according to duration of androgen suppression: 6 months of androgen suppression plus radiotherapy (6AS+RT) versus 18 months of androgen suppression plus radiotherapy (18AS+RT) and to compare treatments according to whether or not patients received zoledronic acid. The total number of deaths was 375 (200 men receiving 6AS+RT and 175 men receiving 18AS+RT), of which 143 (38\%) were attributable to prostate cancer (81 men receiving 6AS+RT and 62 men receiving 18AS+RT). When analysed by duration of androgen suppression, the adjusted cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific mortality was 13·3\% (95\% CI 10·3–16·0) for 6AS+RT versus 9·7\% (7·3–12·0) for 18AS+RT, representing an absolute difference of 3·7\% (95\% CI 0·3–7·1; sub-hazard ratio [sHR] 0·70 [95\% CI 0·50–0·98], adjusted p=0·035). The addition of zoledronic acid did not affect prostate cancer-specific mortality; the adjusted cumulative incidence of prostate cancer-specific mortality was 11·2\% (95\% CI 8·7–13·7) with zoledronic acid vs 11·7\% (9·2–14·1) without, representing an absolute difference of −0·5\% (95\% CI −3·8 to 2·9; sHR 0·95 [95\% CI 0·69–1·32], adjusted p=0·78). Although safety analysis was not prespecified for this 10-year analysis, one new serious adverse event (osteonecrosis of the mandible, in a patient who received 18 months of androgen suppression plus zoledronic acid) occurred since our previous report, bringing the total number of cases of this serious adverse event to three ({\textless}1\% out of 530 patients who received zoledronic acid evaluated for safety) and the total number of drug-related serious adverse events to 12 (1\% out of all 1065 patients evaluable for safety). No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study. Interpretation: 18 months of androgen suppression plus radiotherapy is a more effective treatment option for locally advanced prostate cancer than 6 months of androgen suppression plus radiotherapy, but the addition of zoledronic acid to this treatment regimen is not beneficial. Evidence from the RADAR and French Canadian Prostate Cancer Study IV trials suggests that 18 months of androgen suppression with moderate radiation dose escalation is an effective but more tolerable option than longer durations of androgen suppression for men with locally advanced prostate cancer including intermediate and high risk elements.

  abstract = {© 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature. Purpose: Very little is known about the genetic risk factors associated with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), an aggressive clinical subtype characterised by the absence of ER, PR and HER2. p53, the tumour suppressor gene, is essential for maintaining genomic stability in response to cellular stress. In breast cancer, the mutation rates of TP53 vary depending on the subtype, such that ER-negative tumours have a high rate, and in ER-positive tumours they are less common. Previous studies have implicated the intronic polymorphism in TP53 (rs17878362; or PIN3) with an increased risk of developing breast cancer, although little has been discerned on its prevalence in different subtypes. In this study, we investigated the prevalence of the PIN3 genotype in the blood of cohorts with ER-positive and the ER-negative subtype TNBC, and assessed its association with outcome. Methods: We genotyped 656 TNBC and 648 ER-positive breast cancer patients, along with 436 controls, and compared the prevalence of polymorphism rs17878362 in these cohorts. Results: We found there to be no differences in the prevalence of the PIN3 genotype between the ER-positive and TNBC cohorts. Furthermore, no statistically significant difference was observed in the outcome of patients in either cohort with respect to their PIN3 genotype. Conclusions: Taken together, our results do not support an association of the PIN3 genotype with increased breast cancer risk, either in ER-positive or ER-negative patients.},

  abstract = {© The Author(s) 2018. Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) are the most common gynecological tumors, which are enriched in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Fibroids are leading cause of abnormal uterine bleeding and hysterectomy. One of the major questions yet to be answered is the overproduction of specific ECM components in human uterine fibroids, particularly in relation to mutations in the driver gene mediator complex subunit 12 (MED12). Surgical specimens from 14 patients with uterine leiomyoma having fibroids and corresponding adjacent normal myometrium (ANM) were utilized to analyze genetic and proteomic expression patterns in the tissue samples. MED12 mutations in the fibroids were screened by Sanger sequencing. iTRAQ was used to label the peptides in small-, medium-, and large-sized fibroid samples of annotated MED12 mutation from the same patient. The mixtures of the peptides were fractionated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify the differential expression proteins. Using isobaric tagged-based quantitative mass spectrometry on 3 selected patients, ECM-related protein tenascin-C (TNC) was observed significantly upregulated ({\textgreater}1.5-fold) with a confidence corresponding to false discovery rate (FDR) {\textless}1\% in small-, medium-, and large-sized fibroid samples regardless of MED12 mutation status. The TNC was validated on additional patient samples using Western blotting (WB) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) and confirmed significant overexpression of this protein in fibroids compared to matched ANM. Proteomic analyses have identified the increased ECM protein expression, TNC, as a hallmark of uterine fibroids regardless of MED12 mutations. Further functional studies focusing on the upregulated ECM proteins in leiomyogenesis will lead to the identification of novel ECM drug targets for fibroid treatment.},

  abstract = {© 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Nitric oxide (NO) facilitates anti-atherosclerotic effects. Vegetables are a major source of dietary nitrate. Experimental data indicates that dietary nitrate can significantly reduce major risk factors for atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD), as nitrate can be metabolized to produce NO via the nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway. The purpose of this study was to prospectively investigate the association between habitual dietary nitrate intakes and the incidence of self-reported CVD-related complications within a representative sample of middle-aged Australian women (1946–1951 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health). Women free from disease at baseline who had completed the food frequency questionnaire data were included. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CI) across quartiles for nitrate intakes. Of the 5324 women included for analysis, there were 1951 new cases of CVD-related complications over 15-years of follow-up. Women reporting higher total dietary nitrate intakes (Q4 {\textgreater} 78.2 mg/day) and vegetable nitrate intakes (Q4 {\textgreater} 64.4 mg/day) were 25\% and 27\% reduced risk of developing CVD-related complications respectively, compared with women reporting low total (Q1 {\textless} 45.5 mg/day) and vegetable nitrate intakes (Q1 {\textless} 34.8 mg/day). Our findings were consistent with other observational data indicating that dietary nitrate may explain some of the cardiovascular benefits of vegetable consumption.},

  abstract = {© 2019 Elsevier Ltd Introduction: Health providers are lacking in their provision of smoking cessation care during pregnancy. The aim of this study was to systematically review all available global studies on the effectiveness of interventions in improving health providers’ provision of smoking cessation care during pregnancy. Methods: Five databases were searched, Inclusion criteria included all intervention study types. Two reviewers screened abstracts and full texts independently. Interventions were characterized according to the Effective Practice Of Care taxonomy. Random-effects meta-analyses examined intervention effects on smoking cessation care components based on the 5As. Estimates were number of participants reporting each outcome, or mean score, transformed into Cohen's d. Crude meta-regressions, and meta-analysis subgrouping, were performed to examine whether intervention effects for ‘Ask’ ‘Advise’ and ‘Assist’ differed by intervention components. Results: Of 3165 manuscripts, 16 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Pooled analysis showed significant small to large intervention effects on the different care components (Cohen's d ranging from 0.47 for ‘Ask’ (95\%CI 0.13–0.81) to 1.12 (95\%CI 0.45–1.79) for ‘Setting a quit date’). Crude meta-regression suggested that for ‘Ask’ having a theoretical basis may improve effectiveness (Cohen's d difference 0.62, 95\% CI 0.12–1.1). Subgrouping the meta-analysis suggested that audit and feedback possibly increases intervention effectiveness for ‘Advise’ and ‘Assist’. Conclusion: Interventions designed to improve provision of smoking cessation care during pregnancy show a small increase in care components. Studies vary substantially in design, intervention components, and outcome measurement, impacting ability to synthesize available data. Audit and feedback and enhancing intervention design by using behaviour change theories may improve effectiveness. Registration: PROSPERO CRD42016030143.},

Objectives This study aimed to examine the impact of the a € ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy' intervention on individual health providers (HPs) smoking cessation care (SCC) knowledge, attitudes and practices in general, and specifically regarding nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) prescription. Design Step-wedge clustered randomised controlled study. HPs answered a preintervention and 1-6 months postintervention survey. Setting Six Aboriginal Medical Services (AMSs) in three states of Australia. Participants All HPs were invited to participate. Of 93 eligible, 50 consented (54\%), 45 completed the presurvey (90\%) and 20 the post (40\%). Intervention Included three 1-hour webinar sessions, educational resource package and free oral NRT. Outcomes HPs knowledge was measured using two composite scores - one from all 24 true/false statements, and one from 12 NRT-specific statements. Self-assessment of 22 attitudes to providing SCC were measured using a five-point Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly agree). Two composite mean scores were calculated - one for 15 general SCC attitudes, and one for 7 NRT-specific attitudes. Self-reported provision of SCC components was measured on a five-point Likert scale (Never to Always). Feasibility outcomes, and data collected on the service and patient level are reported elsewhere. Results Mean knowledge composite scores improved from pre to post (78\% vs 84\% correct, difference 5.95, 95\% CI 1.57 to 10.32). Mean NRT-specific knowledge composite score also improved (68\% vs 79\% correct, difference 9.9, 95\% CI 3.66 to 16.14). Mean attitude composite score improved (3.65 (SD 0.4) to 3.87 (SD 0.4), difference 0.23, 95\% CI 0.05 to 0.41). Mean NRT-specific attitudes composite score also improved (3.37 (SD 0.6) to 3.64 (SD 0.7), difference 0.36, 95\% CI 0.13 to 0.6). Self-reported practices were unchanged, including prescribing NRT. Conclusions A multicomponent culturally sensitive intervention in AMSs was feasible, and might improve HPs provision of SCC to pregnant Aboriginal women. Changes in NRT prescription rates may require additional intensive measures. Trial registration number ACTRN 12616001603404; Results.},

A stretching intervention may increase ankle dorsiflexion and reduce plantar pressures in people with diabetes. Methods: Two arm parallel randomised controlled trial from September 2016 to October 2017. Adults with diabetes and ankle equinus (≤5° dorsiflexion) were randomly allocated to receive an 8 week static calf stretching intervention or continue with their normal activities. Primary outcome measures were change in weight bearing and non-weight bearing ankle dorsiflexion and forefoot peak plantar pressure. Secondary outcome measures were forefoot pressure time integrals and adherence to the stretching intervention. Findings: 68 adults (mean (standard deviation) age and diabetes duration 67.4 (10.9) years and 14.0 (10.8) years, 64.7\% male) were randomised to stretch (n = 34) or usual activity (n = 34). At follow up, no significant differences were seen between groups (adjusted mean difference) for non-weight (+1.3°, 95\% CI:−0.3 to 2.9, p = 0.101) and weight bearing ankle dorsiflexion (+0.5°, 95\% CI:−2.6 to 3.6, p = 0.743) or forefoot in-shoe (+1.5 kPa, 95\% CI:−10.0 to 12.9, p = 0.803) or barefoot peak pressures (−19.1 kPa, 95\% CI:−96.4 to 58.1, p = 0.628).

Introduction Treatment fidelity is an important and often neglected component of complex behaviour change research. It is central to understanding treatment effects, especially for evaluations conducted outside of highly controlled research settings. Ensuring that promising interventions can be delivered adequately (ie, with fidelity) by real-world clinicians within real-world settings is an essential step in developing interventions that are both effective and 'implementable'. Whether this is the case for behaviour change counselling, a complex intervention developed specifically for maximising the effectiveness of real-world consultations about health behaviour change, remains unclear. To improve our understanding of treatment effects, best practice guidelines recommend the use of strategies to enhance, monitor and evaluate what clinicians deliver during patient consultations. There has yet to be a systematic evaluation of whether and how these recommendations have been employed within evaluations of behaviour change counselling, nor the impact on patient health behaviour and/or outcome. We seek to address this gap. Methods and analysis Methods are informed by published guidelines. Ten electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, ScienceDirect, Taylor and Francis; Wiley, ProQuest and Open Grey) will be searched for published and unpublished articles that evaluate behaviour change counselling within real-world clinical settings (randomised and non-randomised). Eligible papers will be rated against the National Institute of Health fidelity framework. A synthesis, evaluation and critical overview of fidelity practices will be reported and linear regression used to explore change across time. Random-effect meta-regression is planned to explore whether fidelity (outcomes reported and methods used) is associated with the impact of behaviour change counselling. Standardised effect sizes will be calculated using Hedges' g (continuous outcomes) and ORs (binary/dichotomous outcomes). Ethics and dissemination No ethical issues are foreseen. Findings will be disseminated via journal publication and conference presentation(s). PROSPERO registration number CRD42019131169},

  abstract = {© 2019 The Author(s). Background: The ankle brachial index (ABI) is widely used in clinical practice as a non-invasive method to detect the presence and severity of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Current guidelines suggest that it should be used to monitor potential progression of PAD in affected individuals. As such, it is important that the test is reliable when used for repeated measurements, by the same or different health practitioners. This systematic review aims to examine the literature to evaluate the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the ABI. Methods: A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL Complete was conducted to 20 January 2019. Two authors independently reviewed and selected relevant studies and extracted the data. Methodological quality was determined using the Quality Appraisal of Reliability (QAREL) Checklist. Results: Fifteen studies of ABI reliability in a range of patient populations were identified as suitable for inclusion in the review: seven considered inter-rater reliability, four intra-rater reliability, and four studies evaluated both inter- and intra-rater reliability. Inter-rater reliability was found to be highly variable, with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC's) ranging from poor to excellent (ICC 0.42-1.00), while intra-rater also demonstrated considerable variation, with ICCs from 0.42-0.98. Meta-analysis was not possible due to the lack of statistical information reported. Conclusions: Results of included studies suggest the inter- and intra-tester reliability of the ABI is acceptable. However, inconsistencies in obtaining systolic pressure measurements, calculating ABI values, and incomplete reporting of methodologies and statistical analysis make it difficult to determine the validity of the results of included studies. Further research, with more consistent reliability methodology, statistical analysis and reporting conducted in populations at risk of PAD is needed to conclusively determine the ABI reliability.},

  abstract = {© 2019 The Author(s). Background: To investigate the prognostic significance of positron emission tomography (PET) parameters from F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET scans performed pre- and post- chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) for squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (AC). Methods: From January 2013 to January 2017, 19 patients with non-metastatic AC enrolled on a prospective trial underwent FDG-PET/CT imaging before and 12 weeks following CRT. A computer-generated volume of interest (VOI) was snapped around the primary tumour using six different standard uptake value (SUV) thresholds and the following parameters were extracted: SUV max, mean, median, standard deviation and peak as well as metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis. Exact logistic regression and ROC AUC analyses were performed for each metric at each timepoint. Results: With a median follow up of 15.8 months, 3/19 patients had a local recurrence and 5/19 had any recurrence. On post-CRT PET, the median SUV within a VOI bounded by an SUV of 3 correlated with local recurrence (p {\textless} 0.01) and demonstrated excellent discrimination (ROC AUC 1.00, perfect separation was achieved at a median SUV of 3.38). The mean SUV at this threshold did not quite reach significance for prediction of local recurrence (p = 0.06) but demonstrated excellent discrimination (ROC AUC 0.91). The MTV bounded by a threshold of 41\% SUVmax on the pre-CRT PET predicted for any recurrence (p = 0.03) and showed excellent discrimination (ROC AUC 0.89). Conclusions: FDG-PET parameters are predictive of recurrence in AC. FDG-PET may represent a valuable tool for prognostication and response assessment in AC.

Maternal obesity during pregnancy has a detrimental impact on offspring renal development and function. This is pertinent to Indigenous Australians as they are twice as likely as non-Indigenous Australians to develop chronic kidney disease (CKD). The aim of this study was to examine whether there was an association between maternal adiposity and fetal kidney growth in late gestation ({\textgreater}28 weeks) and kidney function in infants, {\textless}2.5 years of age, from the Gomeroi gaaynggal cohort. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was recorded at the first prenatal visit and maternal adiposity indicators (percent body fat and visceral fat area) measured at {\textgreater}28 weeks gestation by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Fetal kidney structure was assessed by ultrasound. Renal function indicators (urinary albumin:creatinine and protein:creatinine) were measured in infants from a spot urine collection from nappies. Multiple linear regression and multi-level mixed effects linear regression models with clustering were used to account for repeated measures of urine. 147 mother-child pairs were examined. Estimated fetal weight (EFW), but not fetal kidney size, was positively associated with maternal adiposity and pre-pregnancy BMI. When adjusted for smoking, combined kidney volume relative to EFW was negatively associated with maternal percentage body fat. Infant kidney function was not influenced by maternal adiposity and pre-pregnancy BMI (n = 84 observations). Current findings show that Indigenous babies born to obese mothers have reduced kidney size relative to EFW. We suggest that these babies are experiencing a degree of glomerular hyperfiltration in utero, and therefore are at risk of developing CKD in later life, especially if their propensity for obesity is maintained. Although no impact on renal function was observed at {\textless}2.5 years of age, long-term follow-up of offspring is required to evaluate potential later life impacts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: At a population level, small reductions in energy intake have the potential to contribute to a reduction in the prevalence of childhood obesity. In many school systems, there is the potential to achieve a reduction in energy intake through modest improvements in foods packed in children's school lunchboxes. This study will assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component intervention that uses an existing school-based communication application to reduce the kilojoule content from discretionary foods and drinks consumed by children from school lunchboxes whilst at school. METHODS: A Type I hybrid effectiveness-implementation cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in up to 36 primary schools in the Hunter New England, Central Coast and Mid North Coast regions of New South Wales, Australia. Designed using the Behaviour Change Wheel, schools will be randomly allocated to receive either a 5-month (1.5 school terms) multi-component intervention that includes: 1) school lunchbox nutrition guidelines; 2) curriculum lessons; 3) information pushed to parents via an existing school-based communication application and 4) additional parent resources to address common barriers to packing healthy lunchboxes or a control arm (standard school practices). The study will assess both child level dietary outcomes and school-level implementation outcomes. The primary trial outcome, mean energy (kJ) content of discretionary lunchbox foods packed in children's lunchboxes, will be assessed at baseline and immediately post intervention (5 months or 1.5 school terms). Analyses will be performed using intention to treat principles, assessing differences between groups via hierarchical linear regression models. DISCUSSION: This study will be the first fully powered randomised controlled trial internationally to examine the impact of an m-health intervention to reduce the mean energy from discretionary food and drinks packed in the school lunchbox. The intervention has been designed with scalability in mind and will address an important evidence gap which, if shown to be effective, has the potential to be applied at a population level.

  abstract = {© 2019 The Author(s). Background: The Thrombolysis ImPlementation in Stroke (TIPS) trial tested the effect of a multicomponent, multidisciplinary, collaborative intervention designed to increase the rates of intravenous thrombolysis via a cluster randomized controlled trial at 20 Australian hospitals (ten intervention, ten control). This sub-study investigated changes in self-reported perceptions and practices of physicians and nurses working in acute stroke care at the participating hospitals. Methods: A survey with 74 statements was administered during the pre-and post-intervention periods to staff at 19 of the 20 hospitals. An exploratory factor analysis identified the structure of the survey items and linear mixed modeling was applied to the final survey domain scores to explore the differences between groups over time. Result: The response rate was 45\% for both the pre-(503 out of 1127 eligible staff from 19 hospitals) and post-intervention (414 out of 919 eligible staff from 18 hospitals) period. Four survey domains were identified: (1) hospital performance indicators, feedback, and training; (2) personal perceptions about thrombolysis evidence and implementation; (3) personal stroke skills and hospital stroke care policies; and (4) emergency and ambulance procedures. There was a significant pre-to post-intervention mean increase (0.21 95\% CI 0.09; 0.34; p {\textless} 0.01) in scores relating to hospital performance indicators, feedback, and training; for the intervention hospitals compared to control hospitals. There was a corresponding increase in mean scores regarding perceptions about the thrombolysis evidence and implementation (0.21, 95\% CI 0.06; 0.36; p {\textless} 0.05). Sub-group analysis indicated that the improvements were restricted to nurses' responses. Conclusion: TIPS resulted in changes in some aspects of nurses' perceptions relating to the evidence for intravenous thrombolysis and its implementation and hospital performance indicators, feedback, and training. However, there is a need to explore further strategies for influencing the views of physicians given limited statistical power in the physician sample.

  abstract = {© 2019 Author(s). Background Stroke events often result in long-term negative health outcomes. People who experience a first stroke event are 30\%-40\% more likely to experience a second stroke event within 5 years. An online secondary prevention programme for stroke survivors may help stroke survivors improve their health risk behaviours and lower their risk of a second stroke. Objectives This paper describes the development and early iteration testing of the usability and acceptability of an online secondary prevention programme for stroke survivors (Prevent 2nd Stroke, P2S). P2S aims to address six modifiable health risk behaviours of stroke: blood pressure, physical activity, nutrition, depression and anxiety, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Methods P2S was developed as an eight-module online secondary prevention programme for stroke survivors. Modelled on the DoTTI (Design and development, Testing early iterations, Testing for effectiveness, Integration and implementation) framework for the development of online programmes, the following stages were followed during programme development: (1) content development and design; and (2) testing early iteration. The programme was pilot-tested with 15 stroke survivors who assessed P2S on usability and acceptability. Results In stage 1, experts provided input for the content development of P2S. In stage 2, 15 stroke survivors were recruited for usability testing of P2S. They reported high ratings of usability and acceptability of P2S. P2S was generally regarded as easy to use' and relevant to stroke survivors'. Participants also largely agreed that it was appropriate to offer lifestyle advice to stroke survivors through the internet. Conclusions The study found that an online secondary prevention programme was acceptable and easily usable by stroke survivors. The next step is to conduct a randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of the programme regarding behaviour change and determine the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.},

  abstract = {© 2019 Asian Pacific Society of Respirology Background and objective: Publicly funded therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) relies on percentage predicted values from pulmonary function testing, for example Australian patients must have a forced vital capacity ≥50\% (\%FVC), transfer factor of the lung for carbon monoxide ≥ 30\% (\%TLco) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/FVC ratio {\textgreater} 0.7. Despite defined cut-off values, no jurisdiction prescribes a reference equation for use; multiple equations exist. We hypothesized that access to subsidized treatment varies depending on the chosen equation. The \%FVC and \%TLco from different commonly used reference equations across general respiratory patients, and IPF-specific patients, were compared. Methods: FVC and TLco measurements from a large general respiratory laboratory and the Australian Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Registry (AIPFR) database were analysed using multiple equations. Differences between \%FVC and \%TLco for each equation were calculated, with particular interest in classification of patients (\%) at the threshold for subsidized treatment. Results: A total of 20 378 general respiratory database results were analysed. The \%FVC ≥ 50\% increased from 86\% with the Roca equation to 96\% with Quanjer (European Coal and Steal Community, ECSC) and \%TLco≥30\% increased from 91\% with Paoletti to 98\% with Thompson. However, overall increase in eligibility for subsidized treatment was modest, varying from 48.2\% to 49.2\%. A total of 545 AIPFR database results were analysed. The \%FVC ≥ 50\% increased from 73\% with Roca to 94\% with Quanjer (ECSC) and \%TLco≥30\% increased from 87\% with Paoletti to 96\% with Miller. Overall eligibility for subsidized treatment in the AIPFR group varied from 73.6\% to 82.8\% between surveyed interstitial lung disease (ILD) centres based entirely on the equation used. Conclusion: Substantial variability exists between reference equations, impacting access to subsidized treatment. Treating clinicians should be aware of this when assessing patients around public funding thresholds.},

Objectives: This study sought to determine, among a large sample of Australian general practice patients: (1) the prevalence of smoking among different levels of alcohol misuse and (2) whether the associations between demographic characteristics and alcohol use differ according to smoking status. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was administered from 2010 to 2011 to 3559 patients from 12 Australian urban general practices. Patients reported their demographic details, smoking status and their alcohol intake. Results: The overall prevalence of reported concurrent smoking and alcohol misuse was 7.8\%. Smokers were 3.81-fold more likely to have a higher level of alcohol consumption than non-smokers (95\% confidence interval 3.13-4.63 P {\textless} 0.0001). There was evidence that smoking was an effect modifier of the relationship between alcohol misuse and chronic illness. Conclusions: There was an increasing prevalence of smoking with increasing level of alcohol consumption. In addition, those with chronic conditions who smoked had greater odds of higher levels of alcohol consumption. Preventative interventions for these substances are needed to reduce the burden associated with concurrent smoking and alcohol misuse. What is known about the topic?: Tobacco and alcohol are the most commonly used substances and contribute to over 10 million deaths annually. The risk of disease is high when using either of these substances, however, concurrent use is associated with a greatly compounded risk. Australian data is limited regarding the prevalence of concurrent tobacco and alcohol misuse, however, international studies suggest variation in prevalence rates between different clinical settings. What does this paper add?: This study examined the prevalence of concurrent smoking and alcohol misuse among different levels of alcohol misuse severity within an Australian general practice setting. Additionally it explored whether the associations between demographic characteristics and alcohol use differ according to smoking status. What are the implications for practitioners?: This study has important implications for disease prevention and the delivery of preventive health services by general practitioners. Considering one in 100 clinical treatments provided in general practice relate to preventative smoking or alcohol counselling, it is critical that efforts are made to ascertain risk factors such as smoking and alcohol misuse to increase treatment rates. General practitioners should consider screening for smoking and alcohol misuse opportunistically during routine clinical encounters, as well as screening for smoking or alcohol misuse if one or the other is present.},

  abstract = {© 2020 Elsevier Ltd Background: Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) is a novel technique for sampling lung tissue for interstitial lung disease diagnosis. The aim of this study was to establish the diagnostic accuracy of TBLC compared with surgical lung biopsy (SLB), in the context of increasing use of TBLC in clinical practice as a less invasive biopsy technique. Methods: COLDICE was a prospective, multicentre, diagnostic accuracy study investigating diagnostic agreement between TBLC and SLB, across nine Australian tertiary hospitals. Patients with interstitial lung disease aged between 18 and 80 years were eligible for inclusion if they required histopathological evaluation to aid diagnosis, after detailed baseline evaluation. After screening at a centralised multidisciplinary discussion (MDD), patients with interstitial lung disease referred for lung biopsy underwent sequential TBLC and SLB under one anaesthetic. Each tissue sample was assigned a number between 1 and 130, allocated in a computer-generated random sequence. Encoded biopsy samples were then analysed by masked pathologists. At subsequent MDD, de-identified cases were discussed twice with either TBLC or SLB along with clinical and radiological data, in random non-consecutive order. Co-primary endpoints were agreement of histopathological features in TBLC and SLB for patterns of definite or probable usual interstitial pneumonia, indeterminate for usual interstitial pneumonia, and alternative diagnosis; and for agreement of consensus clinical diagnosis using TBLC and SLB at MDD. Concordance and κ values were calculated for each primary endpoint. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12615000718549. Findings: Between March 15, 2016, and April 15, 2019, we enrolled 65 patients (31 [48\%] men, 34 [52\%] women; mean age 66·1 years [SD 9·3]; forced vital capacity 83·7\% [SD 14·2]; diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide 63·4\% [SD 12·8]). TBLC (7·1 mm, SD 1·9) and SLB (46·5 mm, 14·9) samples were each taken from two separate ipsilateral lobes. Histopathological agreement between TBLC and SLB was 70·8\% (weighted κ 0·70, 95\% CI 0·55–0·86); diagnostic agreement at MDD was 76·9\% (κ 0·62, 0·47–0·78). For TBLC with high or definite diagnostic confidence at MDD (39 [60\%] of 65 cases), 37 (95\%) were concordant with SLB diagnoses. In the 26 (40\%) of 65 cases with low-confidence or unclassifiable TBLC diagnoses, SLB reclassified six (23\%) to alternative high-confidence or definite MDD diagnoses. Mild-moderate airway bleeding occurred in 14 (22\%) patients due to TBLC. The 90-day mortality was 2\% (one of 65 patients), following acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Interpretation: High levels of agreement between TBLC and SLB for both histopathological interpretation and MDD diagnoses were shown. The TBLC MDD diagnoses made with high confidence were particularly reliable, showing excellent concordance with SLB MDD diagnoses. These data support the clinical utility of TBLC in interstitial lung disease diagnostic algorithms. Further studies investigating the safety profile of TBLC are needed.

  abstract = {© 2019 The Authors Background: Regular methamphetamine use is associated with increased rates of psychiatric symptoms. Although there has been a substantial body of research reporting on the effectiveness of psychological treatments for reducing methamphetamine use, there is a paucity of research examining the effects of these treatments on co-occurring psychiatric symptoms. We addressed this gap by undertaking a systematic review of the evidence of the effectiveness of psychological treatments for methamphetamine use on psychiatric symptom outcomes in randomized controlled trials. Methods: A narrative synthesis of studies was conducted following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement to inform methodology. Eight electronic peer-reviewed databases were searched. Ten eligible studies were assessed. Results: Most studies found an overall reduction in levels of methamphetamine use and psychiatric symptoms among samples as a whole. Although brief interventions were effective, there is evidence that more intensive interventions have greater impact on methamphetamine use and/or psychiatric symptomatology. Intervention attendance was variable. Conclusions: The evidence suggests that a variety of psychological treatments are effective in reducing levels of methamphetamine use and improving psychiatric symptoms. Future research should consider how psychological treatments could maximize outcomes in the co-occurring domains of methamphetamine use and psychiatric symptoms, with increasing treatment attendance as a focus.

  abstract = {© 2019 Elsevier Inc. Purpose: To clarify the relative effects of duration of androgen suppression (AS) and radiation dose escalation (RDE) on distant progression (DP) in men with locally advanced prostate cancer. Methods and Materials: Participants with locally advanced prostate cancer in the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial were randomized to 6 or 18 months AS ± 18 months zoledronic acid (Z). The trial incorporated a RDE program by stratification at randomization and dosing options were 66, 70, or 74 Gy external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), or 46 Gy EBRT plus high-dose-rate brachytherapy boost (HDRB). The primary endpoint for this study was distant progression (DP). Secondary endpoints included local progression, bone progression, prostate cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Effect estimates for AS duration and RDE were derived using Fine and Gray competing risk models adjusting for use of Z, age, tumor stage, Gleason grade group, prostate-specific antigen, and treatment center. Cumulative incidence at 10 years was estimated for each RDE group. Results: A total of 1051 out of 1071 randomized subjects were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Compared with 6 months AS, 18 months AS significantly reduced DP independently of radiation dose (subhazard ratio 0.70; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.56-0.87; P =.002). No statistically significant interaction between effect of AS duration and RT dose was observed (Wald test P =.76). In subgroup analyses, DP was significantly reduced by the longer duration of AS in the 70 Gy and HDRB groups but not in the 66 Gy and 74 Gy. Compared with 70 Gy, HDRB significantly reduced DP (subhazard ratio 0.68 [95\% CI, 0.57-0.80]; P {\textless}.0001) independently of AS duration. At 10 years, adjusted cumulative incidences were 26.1\% (95\% CI, 18.9\%-33.2\%), 26.7\% (22.9\%-30.6\%), 24.9\% (20.0\%-29.8\%) and 19.7\% (15.5\%-23.8\%) for DPs in the respective radiation dose groups. Conclusions: Compared with 6 months AS, 18 months AS reduced DP independently of radiation dose. Men treated with HDRB gained a significant benefit from a longer duration of AS. Evidence of improved oncologic outcomes for HDRB compared with dose-escalated EBRT needs to be confirmed in a randomized trial.},

  abstract = {AIMS:Perineural invasion (PNI) by prostatic adenocarcinoma is debated as a prognostic parameter. This study investigates the prognostic predictive value of PNI in a series of patients with locally advanced prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy and androgen deprivation using 10 year outcome data from the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial. METHODS:Diagnostic prostate biopsies from 976 patients were reviewed and the presence of PNI noted. Patients were followed for 10 years according to the trial protocol or until death. The primary endpoint for the study was time to bone metastasis. Secondary endpoints included time to soft tissue metastasis, transition to castration resistance, prostate cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. RESULTS:PNI was detected in 449 cases (46\%), with 234 cases (24\%) having PNI in more than one core. The presence of PNI was significantly associated with higher ISUP grade, clinical T staging category, National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group, and percent positive biopsy cores. The cumulative probability of bone metastases according to PNI status was significant over the 10 year follow-up interval of the study (log-rank test p{\textless}0.0001). PNI was associated with all endpoints on univariable analysis. After adjusting for baseline clinicopathological and treatment factors, bone metastasis was the only endpoint in which PNI retained its prognostic significance (hazard ratio 1.42, 95\% confidence interval 1.05-1.92, p=0.021). CONCLUSIONS:The association between PNI and the development of bone metastases supports the inclusion of this parameter as a component of the routine histology report. Further this association suggests that evaluation of PNI may assist in selecting those patients who should be monitored more closely during follow-up.},

Objective: To explore if better diet quality scores as a measure of adherence to the Australian Dietary Guidelines (ADG) and the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) are associated with a lower incidence of hypertension and non-fatal CVD.Design: Prospective analysis of the 1946-1951 cohort of the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). The Australian Recommended Foods Score (ARFS) was calculated as an indicator of adherence to the ADG; the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) measured adherence to the MedDiet. Outcomes included hypertension and non-fatal CVD. Generalised estimating equations estimated OR and 95 \% CI across quartiles of diet quality scores.Setting: Australia, 2001-2016.Participants: 1946-1951 cohort of the ALSWH (n 5324), without CVD, hypertension and diabetes at baseline (2001), with complete FFQ data.Results: There were 1342 new cases of hypertension and 629 new cases of non-fatal CVD over 15 years of follow-up. Multivariate analysis indicated that women reporting better adherence to the ARFS (≥38/74) had 15 \% (95 \% CI 1, 28 \%; P = 0·05) lower odds of hypertension and 46 \% (95 \% CI 6, 66 \%; P = 0·1) lower odds of non-fatal CVD. Women reporting better adherence to the MDS (≥8/17) had 27 \% (95 \% CI 15, 47 \%; P = 0·0006) lower odds of hypertension and 30 \% (95 \% CI 2, 50 \%; P = 0·03) lower odds of non-fatal CVD.Conclusions: Better adherence to diet quality scores is associated with lower risk of hypertension and non-fatal CVD. These results support the need for updated evidenced based on the ADG as well as public health nutrition policies in Australia.},

Background: Young adults born preterm have remodeled hearts, i.e., altered cardiac shape and size with impaired cardiac function. At present, the natural history and pattern of prematurity related cardiac remodeling are not clearly established. The aim of this study was to compare the left ventricle (LV) geometry and function of preterm infants at 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) with gestation matched newborn infants. Methods: LV end diastolic volume index (LV EDVI), LV mass index (LVMI), relative wall thickness (RWT), and sphericity index (SI) were prospectively obtained with echocardiography. LV geometry was classified according to the Gaasch method. LV function was assessed by determining ejection fraction (EF), longitudinal strain (LS), mitral annulus systolic motion (s’), and estimated LV filling pressure (E/e’). Results: Eighty-three preterm infants between 23 and 29 weeks gestation, and 40 infants of 36 weeks gestation at birth were analysed. LV EDVI, LVMI, SI, LS, s’, and E/e’ were higher in preterm group while RWT and EF were comparable between groups. LV showed normal geometry in 55.4\%, physiological enlargement in 23\% and dilated hypertrophy in 21.6\% preterm infants. Conclusion: At 36 week, preterm infants have significantly dilated, hypertrophied, and more spherical LV with impaired diastolic function compared with PMA matched newborn infants.},

Studies in other populations have found regular activity breaks have a significant immediate (within-day) positive effect on glucose metabolism. We examined the effects of breaking up uninterrupted sitting with frequent, short bouts of light-intensity physical activity in people with stroke on post-prandial plasma glucose and insulin. Methods: Randomized within-participant crossover trial. We included people between 3 months and 10 years post-stroke, ambulant with minimal assistance and not taking diabetic medication other than metformin. The three experimental conditions (completed in random order) were: sitting for 8 h uninterrupted, sitting with 3 min bouts of light-intensity exercise while standing every 30 min, or sitting with 3 min of walking every 30 min. Meals were standardized and bloods were collected half- to one-hourly via an intravenous cannula. Results: A total of 19 participants (9 female, mean [SD] age 68.2 [10.2]) completed the trial. The majority (n = 12, 63\%) had mild stroke symptoms (National Institutes of Stroke Scale score 0–13). There was no significant effect of experimental condition on glucose (mean [SD] positive incremental area [+iAUC] mmol·L·h-1 under the curve during sitting 42.3 [29.5], standing 47.4 [23.1], walking 44.6 [26.5], p = 0.563) or insulin (mean + iAUC pmol·L·h-1 sitting 14,161 [7,560], standing 14,043 [8,312], walking 14,008 [8,269], p = 0.987). Conclusion: Frequent, short bouts of light-intensity physical activity did not have a significant effect on post-prandial plasma glucose and insulin in this sample of people with stroke. Further studies are needed to identify strategies that improve inactivity-related glucose metabolism after stroke.},

Results * CHeReL linked data of 13 790 males and 5902 females, calculated the average incidence of CIS to be 20.9 per 100 000 and 6.5 per 100 000 respectively in those aged {\textgreater} 50 years, showing a rapid increase in the rates of CIS from 2001. * There was an 11\% (P = 0.04) and 14\% (P = 0.02) annual increase in incidence of CIS in men and women and these rates increased with age. Conclusions * National data (AIHW) substantially underestimate the incidence of CIS in the Australian population. * Patient level data suggest CIS rates are rapidly increasing in Australia despite high treatment rates. * Closer surveillance and awareness of these high rates warrants further study and we recommend that CIS be considered a reportable disease.},

We determined whether larger cancers can be safely transplanted, the risks of adverse events from RKT, and whether RKT confers a survival advantage for patients waiting for transplantation. Methods:In a retrospective cohort study, 23 dialysis patients awaiting transplant underwent RKT at John Hunter Hospital, Australia between 2008 and 2015. Patients were {\textgreater}60 years old and accepted onto the National Organ Matching Service. This RKT Group was divided into donor renal cancers ≤30 mm and {\textgreater}30-≤50 mm. Adverse event profiles for RKT recipients were compared with 22 standard live donor recipients using logistic regression analyses. Recipient and transplant survivals for RKT were compared with 2050 controls from Australian New Zealand Dialysis Transplant Registry using Cox regression models. To increase statistical power for survival analyses, data from 25 RKT recipients from Princess Alexandra Hospital, Brisbane were added, thus creating 48 RKT recipients. Results:There were no significant differences in mortality, transplant failure nor AEs between the 2 cancer Groups. RKT increased the risks of Adverse event profiles (odds ratio: 6.48 [2.92-15.44]; P {\textless} 0.001). RKT reduced mortality risk by 30\% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.70 [0.36-1.07]; P = 0.299) compared with those continuing on the transplant list who may or may not be transplanted. RKT significantly reduced mortality risk for those remaining on dialysis (HR: 2.86 [1.43-5.72]; P = 0.003). Transplant survival for RKT was reduced compared with control deceased donor (HR: 0.42 [0.21-0.83]; P = 0.013) and live donor transplants (HR: 0.33 [0.02-0.86]; P =0.023). Conclusions:The use of larger carefully selected cancer-resected kidneys for transplantation appears safe and effective. RKT confers a possible survival advantage compared with waiting for transplantation, an increased survival compared with those remaining on dialysis but reduced transplant survival.},

The intervention group will receive access to the online programme Prevent 2nd Stroke (P2S); the minimal care control group will receive an email with Internet addresses of generic health sites designed for the general population. The primary outcome, HRQoL, will be measured using the EuroQol-5D. A full analysis plan will compare between groups from baseline to follow-up. Discussion: A low-cost per user option to supplement current care, such as P2S, has the potential to increase HRQoL for stroke survivors, and reduce the risk of second stroke.},

  abstract = {Introduction. Few general practitioners (GP) prescribe opioid substitution therapy. Our aim was to analyse their previously identified motivating factors by describing their frequency and demographic associations. Methods. An anonymous, cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey on opioid prescribing in pain and dependency was distributed across five New South Wales Divisions of GPs. Questions elicited opinions on 11 barriers and five facilitators previously described in qualitative literature. Data were analysed against demographic variables, including opioid substitution therapy prescriber (OSTP) status and postgraduate training status. ‘Profiles’ of non-OSTPs were then constructed using latent class analysis. Results. Of the 1735 surveys posted, there were 404 responses (23.3\%), with 16\% respondents being OSTPs. Frequently reported barriers included: ‘negative experiences with the opioid dependent’ (72\%), ‘heavy workload’ (60\%) and ‘lack of specialist support’ (58\%), with most barriers less frequent among OSTPs. Facilitating factors included: ‘more accessible specialist support’ (75\%), ‘more accessible training’ (67\%) and ‘better evidence of safety and efficacy’ (64\%), with the latter two significantly less frequently among OSTPs. Latent class analysis of the non-OSTPs revealed three distinct clusters. The smallest (‘class 3’) had the least barriers and resembled OSTPs demographically. Discussion and Conclusions. The pattern of motivating factors towards the psychological, social and behavioural challenges of the management of dependency has a predominantly negative bias. However, this lessens with postgraduate training and OSTP experience. Structural and logistical options are identified to promote OSTP recruitment and retention. GPs resembling class 3 may be more amenable to becoming OSTPs and may be worth targeting for recruitment.

  abstract = {Objective.: Our objective was to evaluate the quality of opioid analgesia prescribing in chronic nonmalignant pain (CNMP) by general practitioners (GPs, family physicians). Design.: An anonymous, cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey. Setting.: The setting was five Australian divisions of general practice (geographically based associations of GPs). Methods.: A questionnaire was mailed to all division members. Outcome measures were adherence to individual recommendations of locally derived CNMP practice guidelines. Results.: We received 404 responses (response rate 23.3\%). In the previous fortnight, GPs prescribed long-term continuous opioids for CNMP for a median of 4 and a mean of 7.1 (±8.7) patients with CNMP. Guideline concordance (GLC) was poor, with no GP always compliant with all guideline items, and only 31\% GPs usually employing most items. GLC was highest for the avoidance of high dosages or fast-acting formulations. It was lowest for strategies minimizing individual and public health harms, such as the initiation of opioids on a time-limited trial basis, use of contracts, and the preclusion or management of aberrant behaviors. GLC was positively associated with relevant training or qualifications, registration with the Australian Prescription Drug Monitoring Programme, being an opioid substitution therapy prescriber, and female gender. Conclusions.: In this study, long-term opioids were frequently initiated for CNMP without a quality use-of-medicine approach. Potential sequelae are inadequate treatment of pain and escalating opioid-related harms. These data suggest a need for improved resourcing and training in opioid management across pain and addictions. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Despite these guidelines, screening for chronic kidney disease in general practice settings is often suboptimal. This paper reports the results of a study that evaluated: (a) the effect of an asynchronous web-based e-learning module on general practice nurses' knowledge about chronic kidney disease risk factors and screening practices and (b) general practice nurses' perceived satisfaction with the e-learning module. Changes in chronic kidney disease knowledge were assessed using a pre-test and post-test evaluative design, and satisfaction scores were measured on completion of the module. Participants' baseline knowledge scores were poor, with mean pre-test scores of 3.77 (s.d. 1.66) out of 10. Post-test scores revealed a significant improvement (mean difference 1.81, (95\% CI: 1.53-2.09), P {\textless} 0.01) however, overall final scores remained inadequate. Participants highly rated their satisfaction with the design of the module. Our results suggest that an asynchronous web-based e-learning module can improve general practice nurses' knowledge about chronic kidney disease risk factors and screening practice. Efforts are required to increase practice nurses' access to educational opportunities designed to improve knowledge in this area with the aim of increasing opportunistic screening for chronic kidney disease in the general practice setting.},

  abstract = {© 2019 The Authors Background: Addressing smoking cessation during pregnancy among Aboriginal women is a national priority under the Closing the Gap campaign. There is a need to measure and report interventions to support Aboriginal women during pregnancy. Aim: To quantitatively assess women's smoking experiences over a 12 week ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy program. Methods: Aboriginal women and/or women expecting an Aboriginal baby reported their smoking experiences through repeated cross-sectional survey at baseline, four weeks, and 12 weeks. Self-reported nicotine dependence measures (heaviness of smoking index, strength of urges and frequency of urges to smoke), intentions to quit smoking, quit attempts, use of nicotine replacement therapy were gathered as well as a carbon-monoxide measure at each time point. Results: Expectant mothers (n = 22) of Aboriginal babies participated from six Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services between November 2016 and July 2017. At 12 weeks women reported (n = 17) low heaviness of smoking index 1.21 with high strength of urges 2.64 and frequency of urges 3.00; 12/13 (92\%) reported likely/very likely to quit smoking, made a mean 1.67 number of quit attempts, three women (13.6\%) quit smoking (validated); 5/16 (31\%) reported using nicotine replacement therapy. Discussion: Participating women made multiple quit attempts demonstrating motivation to quit smoking. Smoking cessation interventions should be tailored to address high strength and frequency of nicotine dependence despite low consumption. Conclusion: Prolonged smoking cessation support is recommended to address physical, behavioural and psychological aspect of smoking. Cessation support should address previous quitting experiences to assess smoking dependence and tailoring of support.

  abstract = {© 2019 The Author(s). Background: The implementation of interventions at-scale is required to maximise population health benefits. 'Physical Activity 4 Everyone (PA4E1)' was a multi-component school-based program targeting adolescents attending secondary schools in low socio-economic areas. An efficacy trial of the intervention demonstrated an increase in students' mean minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day and lower weight gain at low incremental cost. This study aims to assess the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of a multi-component implementation support intervention to improve implementation, at-scale, of the evidence based school physical activity (PA) practices of the PA4E1 program. Impact on student PA levels and adiposity will also be assessed, in addition to the cost of implementation. Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial, utilising an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, will be conducted in up to 76 secondary schools located in lower socio-economic areas across four health districts in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Schools will be randomly allocated to a usual practice control arm or a multi-component implementation support intervention to embed the seven school PA practices of the PA4E1 program. The implementation support intervention incorporates seven strategies including executive support, in-School Champion, teacher training, resources, prompts, audit and feedback and access to an external Support Officer. The primary trial outcome will be the proportion of schools meeting at least four of the seven physical activity practices of the program, assessed via surveys with Head Physical Education teachers at 12 and 24-months. Secondary outcomes will be assessed via a nested evaluation of student PA and adiposity at 12-months (Grade 8 students) and 24 months (Grade 9 students) undertaken in 30 schools (15 per group). Resource use associated with the implementation intervention will be measured prospectively. Linear mixed effects regression models will assess program effects on the primary outcome at each follow-up period. Discussion: This study is one of few evidence-based multi-component PA programs scaled-up to a large number of secondary schools and evaluated via randomised controlled trial. The use of implementation science theoretical frameworks to implement the evidence-based program and the rigorous evaluation design are strengths of the study.

  abstract = {© The Author 2017. An increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has long been recognized amongst people with autoimmune disease. It has been unclear whether this is due mainly to the ensuing treatment, particularly steroids, or whether some of this risk is due to the autoimmune process itself with subsequent inflammation. Indeed, a large body of evidence supports a role for chronic inflammation in atherogenesis, and autoantibodies have been identified as mediators in this complex inflammatory environment. Our aim is to carry out a systematic review of existing literature in order to formally establish the strength of the association between autoantibodies and atherosclerosis, amongst individuals without clinical autoimmune disease. An electronic search of five databases to June 2016 was performed by two independent reviewers. Inclusion criteria were analytical studies of adults, with at least two studies per autoantibody. Quality analysis was carried out using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Cochrane Risk of Bias Quality Assessment Tool where appropriate. Where possible, studies were pooled using random effects models. Raised levels of anti-cardiolipin (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30; 95\% CI: 1.15-1.49) and anti-oxidized low-density lipoprotein Immunoglobulin (Ig) G (OR = 1.25; 95\% CI: 1.11-1.41), unspecified anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (OR = 3.09; 95\% CI: 1.49-6.41) and anti-human heat shock protein 60 IgA (OR = 1.57; 95\% CI: 1.15-2.16) were observed to increase the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Alternatively, Anti-phosphorylcholine IgM (OR = 1.31; 95\% CI: 1.14-1.50) conferred protection against CVD. Our results support an important role for autoantibodies in mediating cardiovascular events, independent of therapeutic treatments. Future research may focus on the presence of autoantibodies as markers of immune dysregulation and CVD risk.},

  abstract = {© 2019 Elsevier B.V. Background and purpose: To investigate the role of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MP-MRI) as a biomarker for squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal (SCCAC). Materials and methods: From January 2013 to January 2017, 25 patients with non-metastatic SCCAC were enrolled in a multi-centre prospective clinical trial, of whom 20 completed protocol treatment. MP-MRIs, incorporating diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) sequences, were performed before (baseline), during the second and fourth weeks of chemo-radiotherapy (CRT), and 8 weeks following treatment completion. Histogram analysis of multi-parametric maps generated maximum, mean, median, minimum, skewness, kurtosis, and standard deviation metrics. Exact logistic regression and ROC AUC analyses were performed for each metric at every timepoint. An elastic net LASSO logistic regression was also performed using all measures at each timepoint. Results: With a median follow up of 17.1 months, 3/20 patients had a local recurrence, and 5/20 had any recurrence. Several apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) metrics extracted from DW-MRIs correlated with local recurrence and demonstrated excellent discrimination: baseline skewness (p = 0.04, ROC AUC 0.90) and standard deviation (SD) (p = 0.02, ROC AUC 0.90), week 2 skewness (p = 0.02, ROC AUC 0.91) and SD (p = 0.01, ROC AUC 0.94), week 4 kurtosis (p = 0.01, AUC 0.92) and SD (p = 0.01, ROC AUC 0.96). Changes in minimum ADC between baseline and week 2 (p = 0.02, ROC AUC 0.94) and baseline and week 4 (p = 0.02, ROC AUC 0.94) were prognostic for local recurrence. For prediction of any recurrence, ADC minimum (p = 0.02, ROC AUC 0.87) and SD (p = 0.01, ROC AUC 0.85) at baseline, and ADC maximum (p = 0.03, ROC AUC 0.77) and SD (p = 0.02, ROC AUC 0.81) at week 4 were significant. On LASSO logistic regression, ADC minimum and SD at baseline were retained for any recurrence. The only significant finding for DCE-MRI was a correlation of k-trans min at the second follow-up with local recurrence (p = 0.05, AUC 0.84). Conclusion: Several ADC parameters at various time points correlate with recurrence suggesting DW-MRI is a potential biomarker for SCCAC.},

This study aimed to examine the effectiveness of a web-based information tool and nurse delivered telephone support in reducing: (i) unmet information needs; (ii) depression; and (iii) anxiety, among hematological cancer patients and their support persons (SPs). Methods: Patients with a new diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt lymphoma, or lymphoblastic lymphoma and their SPs were enrolled in a prospective multi-site randomized trial. Participants received either access to an online information tool and telephone support from a hematology nurse, or usual care. Outcome data were collected 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks post-recruitment. The primary endpoint was unmet information needs. Results: Data from 60 patients and 15 SPs were included in the analysis. There were no statistically significant differences in unmet information needs, depression or anxiety between intervention and control groups for patients. Patients in both groups demonstrated a decrease in information needs over the intervention period. Post hoc analyses revealed that patients who did not achieve remission with the first cycle of treatment experienced increased anxiety from 4 weeks until the end of the study (p = 0.008). Conclusions: A web-based information tool and nurse delivered telephone support did not reduce unmet information needs, depression or anxiety among hematological cancer patients, however this finding is inconclusive given the low power of the study. Implications for Psychosocial Providers or Policy: Patients who do not achieve remission are at high risk of anxiety, and may benefit from targeted psychological intervention.},

Background: Indigenous Australians are a socially disadvantaged group who experience significantly poorer health and a higher prevalence of modifiable health behaviours than other Australians. Little is known about the clustering of health risks among Indigenous Australians. The aims of this study were to describe the clustering of key health risk factors, such as smoking, physical inactivity and alcohol consumption, and socio-demographics associated with clusters, among a predominantly Aboriginal sample. Methods: Participants (n = 377) attending an Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service (ACCHS) in regional/rural New South Wales, Australia, in 2012-2013 completed a self-report touch screen health risk survey. Clusters were identified using latent class analysis. Results: Cluster 1 ('low fruit/vegetable intake, lower risk'; 51 \%) consisted of older men and women; Cluster 2 ('risk taking'; 22 \%) included younger unemployed males with a high prevalence of smoking, risky alcohol, and illicit drug use. Cluster 3 ('inactive, overweight, depressed'; 28 \%) was characterised by younger to mid aged women likely to have experienced emotional or physical violence. Conclusions: If future research identifies similar stable clusters of health behaviours for this population, intervention approaches targeting these clusters of risk factors should be developed and tested for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.},

Background: In an attempt to improve children's physical activity levels governments have introduced policies specifying the minimum time schools are to schedule physical activity each week. Despite this, the majority of schools in many jurisdictions fail to implement these policies. This study will assess the effectiveness of a multi-component implementation strategy on increasing the minutes of planned physical activity scheduled by primary school teachers each week. Methods: A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted in 62 primary schools in the Hunter New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Schools will be randomly allocated to receive either a multi-component implementation strategy that includes; obtaining executive support, training in-school champions, provision of tools and resources, implementation prompts, reminders and feedback; or usual practice. The study will employ an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design, assessing both policy implementation and individual (student) behavioural outcomes. The primary trial outcome of mean minutes of physical activity scheduled by classroom teachers across the school week will be measured via teacher log-book at baseline and approximately 12 and 18 months post baseline. A nested evaluation of the impact of policy implementation on child physical activity will be undertaken of students in Grades 2 and 3. Analyses will be performed using an intention to treat framework. Linear mixed effects regression models will be used to assess intervention effects on the primary outcome at both follow-up periods. Discussion: This study will be the one of the first well powered randomised trials internationally to examine the impact of an implementation strategy for a physical activity policy in primary schools and will address a fundamental research translation gap. Given the dearth of research, the findings will be important in informing future implementation efforts in this setting.

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to describe the population-based longitudinal trends in incidence, 30-day mortality and length of stay of hip fracture patients in a tertiary referral trauma centre in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia, and identify the factors associated with increased 30-day mortality. A retrospective database and chart review was conducted to patients aged ≥65 years with a diagnosis of femoral neck or pertrochanteric fracture admitted to the John Hunter Hospital between 01 January 2002 and 30 December 2011. The main outcome measure was 30-day mortality; secondary outcome was acute length of stay. There were 4,269 eligible patients (427±20 per year) with hip fractures over the 10-year study period. The absolute incidence increased slightly (p=0.1) but the age-adjusted rate decreased (p≤0.0001). The average age (83.5±7.1 years) and percentage of females (73.7\%) did not change. Length of stay increased by a factor of 2.5\% per year (p{\textless}0.0001). Thirty-day mortality decreased from 12.3\% in 2002 to 8.20\% in 2011 (p=0.0008). Independent risk factors associated with increased 30-day mortality were longer admissions (p{\textless}0.0001), increased age (p=0.005), dementia (p=0.01), male gender (p{\textless}0.0001), higher American Society of Anaesthesiologists score (p{\textless}0.0001), and longer time to operating theatre (p=0.002). Despite the relative ageing of our population, a decrease in the age-standardised rate of fractured hip in elderly patients has seen the number of admissions remain unchanged in our institution from 2002 to 2011. There was a decrease in 30-day mortality, while length of stay increased.},

  abstract = {Objective: The FOXP2 gene is involved in the development of speech and language. As some single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of FOXP2 have been found to be associated with auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) at trend levels, this study set out to undertake the first examination into whether interactions between candidate FOXP2 SNPs and environmental factors (specifically, child abuse) predict the likelihood of AVHs. Method: Data on parental child abuse and FOXP2 SNPs previously linked to AVHs (rs1456031, rs2396753, rs2253478) were obtained from the Australian Schizophrenia Research Bank for people with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders, both with (n=211) and without (n=122) a lifetime history of AVHs. Results: Genotypic frequencies did not differ between the two groups; however, logistic regression found that childhood parental emotional abuse (CPEA) interacted with rs1456031 to predict lifetime experience of AVH. CPEA was only associated with significantly higher levels of AVHs in people with CC genotypes (odds ratio=4.25), yet in the absence of CPEA, people with TT genotypes had significantly higher levels of AVHs than people with CC genotypes (odds ratio=4.90). This interaction was specific to auditory verbal hallucinations, and did not predict the likelihood of non-verbal auditory hallucinations. Conclusions: Our findings offer tentative evidence that FOXP2 may be a susceptibility gene for AVHs, influencing the probability people experience AVHs in the presence and absence of CPEA. However, these findings are in need of replication in a larger study that addresses the methodological limitations of the present investigation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine the risk factors for developing multidrug resistant tuberculosis in Bangladesh. Methods: This case-control study was set in central, district and sub-district level hospitals of rural and urban Bangladesh. Included were 250 multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients as cases and 750 drug susceptible tuberculosis patients as controls. We recruited cases from all three government hospitals treating MDR-TB in Bangladesh during the study period. Controls were selected randomly from those local treatment units that had referred the cases. Information was collected through face-to-face interviews and record reviews. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression were used to analyse the data. Results: Previous treatment history was shown to be the major contributing factor to MDR-TB in univariate analysis. After adjusting for other factors in multivariable analysis, age group "18-25" (OR 1.77, CI 1.07-2.93) and "26-45" (OR 1.72, CI 1.12-2.66), some level of education (OR 1.94, CI 1.32-2.85), service and business as occupation (OR 2.88, CI 1.29-6.44; OR 3.71, CI 1.59-8.66, respectively), smoking history (OR 1.58, CI 0.99-2.5), and type 2 diabetes (OR 2.56 CI 1.51-4.34) were associated with MDR-TB. Previous treatment was not included in the multivariable analysis as it was correlated with multiple predictors. Conclusion: Previous tuberculosis treatment was found to be the major risk factor for MDR-TB. This study also identified age 18 to 45 years, some education up to secondary level, service and business as occupation, past smoking status, and type 2 diabetes as comorbid illness as risk factors. National Tuberculosis programme should address these risk factors in MDR-TB control strategy. The integration of MDR-TB control activities with diabetes and tobacco control programmes is needed in Bangladesh. © 2014 Rifat et al.},

Even after correcting for general cognitive ability, numerous studies report a negative association between ADHD and educational achievement. With polygenic scores we examined whether genetic variants that have a positive influence on educational attainment have a protective effect against ADHD. The effect sizes from a large GWA meta-analysis of educational attainment in adults were used to calculate polygenic scores in an independent sample of 12-year-old children from the Netherlands Twin Register. Linear mixed models showed that the polygenic scores significantly predicted educational achievement, school performance, ADHD symptoms and attention problems in children. These results confirm the genetic overlap between ADHD and educational achievement, indicating that one way to gain insight into genetic variants responsible for variation in ADHD is to include data on educational achievement, which are available at a larger scale. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Early detection is a key predictive factor achieved by increasing public awareness and participation in screening. This observational study measures awareness of gynaecological malignancies, particularly uterine, among women in two rural areas of New South Wales, Australia. Patients presenting to gynaecology clinics in January to March 2014 were invited to complete a structured questionnaire. Women with a history of cancer and incomplete questionnaires were excluded. Of the 382 patients invited to participate, 329 (86\%) responded with complete feedback. Most respondents were younger than than 50 years (66\%) and married with at least 2 children (74\%). The majority (94\%) of participants had no awareness of uterine cancer and many (46\%) were unable to identify common risk factors including obesity, diabetes and hypertension. The ability to identify risk factors was correlated to age, marital status and obesity. The study identifies poor awareness on uterine malignancies in two typical areas of rural Australia. Although external validity is limited by sociological factors, poor awareness of uterine cancer among rural patients in this study represents a valid public health concern. It is imperative to improve awareness of uterine cancer and available screening programs to facilitate early detection and cure.},

Asia is developing as the epicentre of the escalating pandemic, reflecting rapid transitions in demography, migration, diet, and lifestyle patterns. The effective management of Type 2 diabetes in Asia may be complicated by differences in prevalence, risk factor profiles, genetic risk allele frequencies, and gene-environment interactions between different Asian countries, and between Asian and other continental populations. To reduce the worldwide burden of T2D, it will be important to understand the architecture of T2D susceptibility both within and between populations. This review will provide an overview of known genetic and nongenetic risk factors for T2D, placing the results from Asian studies in the context of broader global research. Given recent evidence from large-scale genetic studies of T2D, we place special emphasis on emerging knowledge about the genetic architecture of T2D and the potential contribution of genetic effects to population differences in risk. © 2014 Noraidatulakma Abdullah et al.},

We performed a meta-analysis of genome-wide association (GWA) studies to assess the genetic determinants of heel broadband ultrasound attenuation (BUA; n 5 14 260), velocity of sound (VOS; n 5 15 514) and BMD (n 5 4566) in 13 discovery cohorts. Independent replication involved seven cohorts with GWA data (in silico n 5 11 452) and new genotyping in 15 cohorts (de novo n 5 24 902). In combined random effects, meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts, nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) had genome-wide significant (P {\textless} 5 3 108) associations with heel bone properties. Alongside SNPs within or near previously identified osteoporosis susceptibility genes including ESR1 (6q25.1: rs4869739, rs3020331, rs2982552), SPTBN1 (2p16.2: rs11898505), RSPO3 (6q22.33: rs7741021), WNT16 (7q31.31: rs2908007), DKK1 (10q21.1: rs7902708) and GPATCH1 (19q13.11: rs10416265), we identified a new locus on chromosome 11q14.2 (rs597319 close to TMEM135, a gene recently linked to osteoblastogenesis and longevity) significantly associated with both BUA and VOS (P {\textless} 8.23 3 1014). In meta-analyses involving 25 cohorts with up to 14 985 fracture cases, six of 10 SNPs associated with heel bone properties at P {\textless} 5 3 106 also had the expected direction of association with any fracture (P {\textless} 0.05), including threeSNPswithP {\textless} 0.005: 6q22.33 (rs7741021), 7q31.31 (rs2908007) and 10q21.1 (rs7902708). In conclusion, thisGWAstudy reveals the effect of several genescommon to central DXA-derivedBMDand heel ultrasound/DXAmeasures and points to anewgenetic locus with potential implications for better understanding of osteoporosis pathophysiology. © The Author 2014.

  abstract = {© 2014 Elsevier Ltd. Background: We investigated whether 18 months of androgen suppression plus radiotherapy, with or without 18 months of zoledronic acid, is more effective than 6 months of neoadjuvant androgen suppression plus radiotherapy with or without zoledronic acid. Methods: We did an open-label, randomised, 2 × 2 factorial trial in men with locally advanced prostate cancer (either T2a N0 M0 prostatic adenocarcinomas with prostate-specific antigen [PSA] ≥10 μg/L and a Gleason score of ≥7, or T2b-4 N0 M0 tumours regardless of PSA and Gleason score). We randomly allocated patients by computer-generated minimisation-stratified by centre, baseline PSA, tumour stage, Gleason score, and use of a brachytherapy boost-to one of four groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. Patients in the control group were treated with neoadjuvant androgen suppression with leuprorelin (22·5 mg every 3 months, intramuscularly) for 6 months (short-term) and radiotherapy alone (designated STAS); this procedure was either followed by another 12 months of androgen suppression with leuprorelin (intermediate-term; ITAS) or accompanied by 18 months of zoledronic acid (4 mg every 3 months for 18 months, intravenously; STAS plus zoledronic acid) or by both (ITAS plus zoledronic acid). The primary endpoint was prostate cancer-specific mortality. This analysis represents the first, preplanned assessment of oncological endpoints, 5 years after treatment. Analysis was by intention-to-treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00193856. Findings: Between Oct 20, 2003, and Aug 15, 2007, 1071 men were randomly assigned to STAS (n=268), STAS plus zoledronic acid (n=268), ITAS (n=268), and ITAS plus zoledronic acid (n=267). Median follow-up was 7·4 years (IQR 6·5-8·4). Cumulative incidences of prostate cancer-specific mortality were 4·1\% (95\% CI 2·2-7·0) in the STAS group, 7·8\% (4·9-11·5) in the STAS plus zoledronic acid group, 7·4\% (4·6-11·0) in the ITAS group, and 4·3\% (2·3-7·3) in the ITAS plus zoledronic acid group. Cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality was 17·0\% (13·0-22·1), 18·9\% (14·6-24·2), 19·4\% (15·0-24·7), and 13·9\% (10·3-18·8), respectively. Neither prostate cancer-specific mortality nor all-cause mortality differed between control and experimental groups. Cumulative incidence of PSA progression was 34·2\% (28·6-39·9) in the STAS group, 39·6\% (33·6-45·5) in the STAS plus zoledronic acid group, 29·2\% (23·8-34·8) in the ITAS group, and 26·0\% (20·8-31·4) in the ITAS plus zoledronic acid group. Compared with STAS, no difference was noted in PSA progression with ITAS or STAS plus zoledronic acid; however, ITAS plus zoledronic acid reduced PSA progression (sub-hazard ratio [SHR] 0·71, 95\% CI 0·53-0·95; p=0·021). Cumulative incidence of local progression was 4·1\% (2·2-7·0) in the STAS group, 6·1\% (3·7-9·5) in the STAS plus zoledronic acid group, 1·5\% (0·5-3·7) in the ITAS group, and 3·4\% (1·7-6·1) in the ITAS plus zoledronic acid group; no differences were noted between groups. Cumulative incidences of bone progression were 7·5\% (4·8-11·1), 14·6\% (10·6-19·2), 8·4\% (5·5-12·2), and 7·6\% (4·8-11·2), respectively. Compared with STAS, STAS plus zoledronic acid increased the risk of bone progression (SHR 1·90, 95\% CI 1·14-3·17; p=0·012), but no differences were noted with the other two groups. Cumulative incidence of distant progression was 14·7\% (10·7-19·2) in the STAS group, 17·3\% (13·0-22·1) in the STAS plus zoledronic acid group, 14·2\% (10·3-18·7) in the ITAS group, and 11·1\% (7·6-15·2) in the ITAS plus zoledronic acid group; no differences were recorded between groups. Cumulative incidence of secondary therapeutic intervention was 25·6\% (20·5-30·9), 28·9\% (23·5-34·5), 20·7\% (16·1-25·9), and 15·3\% (11·3-20·0), respectively. Compared with STAS, ITAS plus zoledronic acid reduced the need for secondary therapeutic intervention (SHR 0·67, 95\% CI 0·48-0·95; p=0·024); no differences were noted with the other two groups. An interaction between trial factors was recorded for Gleason score; therefore, we did pairwise comparisons between all groups. Post-hoc analyses suggested that the reductions in PSA progression and decreased need for secondary therapeutic intervention with ITAS plus zoledronic acid were restricted to tumours with a Gleason score of 8-10, and that ITAS was better than STAS in tumours with a Gleason score of 7 or lower. Long-term morbidity and quality-of-life scores were not affected adversely by 18 months of androgen suppression or zoledronic acid. Interpretation: Compared with STAS, ITAS plus zoledronic acid was more effective for treatment of prostate cancers with a Gleason score of 8-10, and ITAS alone was effective for tumours with a Gleason score of 7 or lower. Nevertheless, these findings are based on secondary endpoint data and post-hoc analyses and must be regarded cautiously. Long- term follow-up is necessary, as is external validation of the interaction between zoledronic acid and Gleason score. STAS plus zoledronic acid can be ruled out as a potential therapeutic option.

Newly implicated regions were followed up in samples from African-American, Korean, Chinese and Hispanic individuals. We detected transcripts for all six newly implicated genes in human lung tissue.

  abstract = {© 2014 American Heart Association, Inc. Background and Purpose - Epidemiological studies show strong associations between kidney dysfunction and risk of ischemic stroke (IS), the mechanisms of which are incompletely understood. We investigated whether these associations may reflect shared heritability because of a common polygenic basis and whether this differed for IS subtypes.Methods - Polygenic models were derived using genome-wide association studies meta-analysis results for 3 kidney traits: estimated glomerular filtration rate using serum creatinine (eGFRcrea: n=73 998), eGFR using cystatin C (eGFRcys: n=22 937), and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (n=31 580). For each, single nucleotide polymorphisms passing 10 P value thresholds were used to form profile scores in 4561 IS cases and 7094 controls from the United Kingdom, Germany, and Australia. Scores were tested for association with IS and its 3 aetiological subtypes: large artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, and small vessel disease.Results - Polygenic scores correlating with higher eGFRcrea were associated with reduced risk of large artery atherosclerosis, with 5 scores reaching P{\textless}0.05 (peak P=0.004) and all showing the epidemiologically expected direction of effect. A similar pattern was observed for polygenic scores reflecting higher urinary albumin to creatinine ratio, of which 3 associated with large artery atherosclerosis (peak P=0.01) and all showed the expected directional association. One urinary albumin to creatinine ratio-based score also associated with small vessel disease (P=0.03). The global pattern of results was unlikely to have occurred by chance (P=0.02).Conclusions - This study suggests possible polygenic correlation between renal dysfunction and IS. The shared genetic components may be specific to stroke subtypes, particularly large artery atherosclerotic stroke. Further study of the genetic relationships between these disorders seems merited.},

A central component of supervision in-consultation information-seeking of GP trainees from their trainer has not been documented. We aimed to establish the prevalence, characteristics and associations (trainee, practice, patient and consultation) of this information-seeking. Methods Australian trainees recorded demographic, clinical and educational details of 60 consecutive consultations in each GP term of their training, including the rate and nature of information-seeking. Results Six-hundred and forty-five trainees contributed data for 1426 trainee-rounds, 84 723 consultations and 131 583 problems. Information was sought from the trainer for 9130 (6.9\% (95\% CI 6.87.1)) of all problems encountered (and in 7833 (9.2\% (95\% CI 9.09.4)) of consultations): 11.7\% (95\% CI 11.0 12.4) were for diagnosis, 53.1\% (95\% CI 52.154.2) for management and 35.2\% (95\% CI 34.236.2) for both diagnosis and management. Assistance was sought most commonly for skin problems (20.0\%) and musculoskeletal problems (12.6\%). Significant adjusted associations of informationseeking included patient age; male patient gender; earlier training term; trainee being younger and female; trainee's training organisation; longer consultation; and trainee generation of learning goals. Discussion Our findings have implications for trainer workload and professional development, patient care and trainee education and training.},

  abstract = {© 2015 Society of Biological Psychiatry. BACKGROUND: Memory performance in older persons can reflect genetic influences on cognitive function and dementing processes. We aimed to identify genetic contributions to verbal declarative memory in a community setting. METHODS: We conducted genome-wide association studies for paragraph or word list delayed recall in 19 cohorts from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium, comprising 29,076 dementia- and stroke-free individuals of European descent, aged ≥45 years. Replication of suggestive associations (p {\textless} 5 × 10-6) was sought in 10,617 participants of European descent, 3811 African-Americans, and 1561 young adults. RESULTS: rs4420638, near APOE, was associated with poorer delayed recall performance in discovery (p = 5.57 × 10-10) and replication cohorts (p = 5.65 × 10-8). This association was stronger for paragraph than word list delayed recall and in the oldest persons. Two associations with specific tests, in subsets of the total sample, reached genome-wide significance in combined analyses of discovery and replication (rs11074779 [HS3ST4], p = 3.11 × 10-8, and rs6813517 [SPOCK3], p = 2.58 × 10-8) near genes involved in immune response. A genetic score combining 58 independent suggestive memory risk variants was associated with increasing Alzheimer disease pathology in 725 autopsy samples. Association of memory risk loci with gene expression in 138 human hippocampus samples showed cis-associations with WDR48 and CLDN5, both related to ubiquitin metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: This largest study to date exploring the genetics of memory function in ∼40,000 older individuals revealed genome-wide associations and suggested an involvement of immune and ubiquitin pathways.},

  abstract = {© 2015 by National Stroke Association. Background: The Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration of symptoms, Diabetes (ABCD2) score can be used to predict early recurrent stroke risk following Transient ischemic attack (TIA). Given that recurrent stroke risk can be as high as 20\% in the first week, international guidelines recommend ''high-risk'' TIAs (ABCD2 .3) be seen by specialist services such as dedicated acute neurovascular clinics within 24 hours. The goal of this study was to examine the associations of both quality of referrals to a specialist acute clinic and of "guideline congruence" of time-to-clinic consultation after TIA/minor stroke. We hypothesized highquality referrals containing key clinical elements would be associated with greater guideline congruence. Methods: A retrospective analysis of referrals to an acute neurovascular clinic within a tertiary care hospital of consecutive patients with TIA/minor stroke. Quality of general practitioner and emergency department referrals was defined on the basis of information content enabling ABCD2-based risk stratification by the clinic triage service. Time-to-clinic consultation was used to define "guideline congruence." Results: Referrals of 148 consecutive eligible patients were reviewed. Sixty-six percent of cases were subsequently neurologist-diagnosed as TIA or minor stroke. Seventy-nine percent were referred by general practitioners. Fifty-three percent of referrals were of high quality, but quality was not associated with guideline congruence. Of the high-risk patients, only 3.6\% were seen at the clinic within 24 hours of index event and 31.3\% within 24 hours of referral. Conclusions: Current guidelines are pathophysiologically logical and evidence based, but are difficult to implement. Improving quality of primary-secondary communication by improved referral quality is unlikely to improve guideline compliance. Alternative strategies are needed to reduce recurrent stroke risk after TIA/minor stroke.},

  abstract = {© 2015 American Heart Association, Inc. Background and Purpose: Despite moderate heritability, the phenotypic heterogeneity of ischemic stroke has hampered gene discovery, motivating analyses of diagnostic subtypes with reduced sample sizes. We assessed evidence for a shared genetic basis among the 3 major subtypes: large artery atherosclerosis (LAA), cardioembolism, and small vessel disease (SVD), to inform potential cross-subtype analyses. Methods: Analyses used genome-wide summary data for 12 389 ischemic stroke cases (including 2167 LAA, 2405 cardioembolism, and 1854 SVD) and 62 004 controls from the Metastroke consortium. For 4561 cases and 7094 controls, individual-level genotype data were also available. Genetic correlations between subtypes were estimated using linear mixed models and polygenic profile scores. Meta-analysis of a combined LAA-SVD phenotype (4021 cases and 51 976 controls) was performed to identify shared risk alleles. Results: High genetic correlation was identified between LAA and SVD using linear mixed models (rg=0.96, SE=0.47, P=9×10-4) and profile scores (rg=0.72; 95\% confidence interval, 0.52.0.93). Between LAA and cardioembolism and SVD and cardioembolism, correlation was moderate using linear mixed models but not significantly different from zero for profile scoring. Joint meta-analysis of LAA and SVD identified strong association (P=1×10-7) for single nucleotide polymorphisms near the opioid receptor μ1 (OPRM1) gene. Conclusions.Our results suggest that LAA and SVD, which have been hitherto treated as genetically distinct, may share a substantial genetic component. Combined analyses of LAA and SVD may increase power to identify small-effect alleles influencing shared pathophysiological processes.},

We report 13 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations in three genomic regions, 6q16.1, 14q12 and 19q13.32 (best SNP and closest gene, respectively: rs10457441, P=3.93 × 10-9, MIR2113; rs17522122, P=2.55 × 10-8, AKAP6; rs10119, P=5.67 × 10-9, APOE/TOMM40). We report one gene-based significant association with the HMGN1 gene located on chromosome 21 (P=1 × 10-6). These genes have previously been associated with neuropsychiatric phenotypes. Meta-analysis results are consistent with a polygenic model of inheritance. To estimate SNP-based heritability, the genome-wide complex trait analysis procedure was applied to two large cohorts, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (N=6617) and the Health and Retirement Study (N=5976). The proportion of phenotypic variation accounted for by all genotyped common SNPs was 29\% (s.e.=5\%) and 28\% (s.e.=7\%), respectively. Using polygenic prediction analysis, ∼1.2\% of the variance in general cognitive function was predicted in the Generation Scotland cohort (N=5487; P=1.5 × 10-17). In hypothesis-driven tests, there was significant association between general cognitive function and four genes previously associated with Alzheimer's disease: TOMM40, APOE, ABCG1 and MEF2C.},

  abstract = {Background: The relative effects of radiation dose escalation (RDE) and androgen suppression (AS) duration on local prostatic progression (LP) remain unclear. Methods: We addressed this in the TROG 03.04 RADAR trial by incorporating a RDE programme by stratification at randomisation. Men were allocated 6 or 18. months AS. ±. 18. months zoledronate (Z). The main endpoint was a composite of clinically diagnosed LP or PSA progression with a PSA doubling time ≥6. months. Fine and Gray competing risk modelling with adjustment for site clustering produced cumulative incidence estimates at 6.5. years for each RDE group. Results: Composite LP declined coherently in the 66, 70 and 74. Gy external beam dosing groups and was lowest in the high dose rate brachytherapy boost (HDRB) group. At 6.5. years, adjusted cumulative incidences were 22\%, 15\%, 13\% and 7\% respectively. Compared to 6. months AS, 18. months AS also significantly reduced LP (p {\textless}. 0.001). Post-radiation urethral strictures were documented in 45 subjects and increased incrementally in the dosing groups. Crude incidences were 0.8\%, 0.9\%, 3.8\% and 12.7\% respectively. Conclusion: RDE and increasing AS independently reduce LP and increase urethral strictures. The risks and benefits to the individual must be balanced when selecting radiation dose and AS duration.},

People with a history of stroke or heart disease are at increased risk of future stroke; therefore, identification of risk factors by GPs is critical. Objectives. To compare the following among general practice patients with and without a history of stroke or heart disease: (i) self-reported prevalence rates of lifestyle risk factors; (ii) accuracy of GP detection of patient-reported risk factors and (iii) average proportion of patient-reported risk factors detected by GPs. Methods. Consecutive patients attending a participating general practice clinic were invited to participate in a cross-sectional touchscreen survey assessing lifestyle risk factors in 2010-11. The GP of each consenting patient completed a corresponding survey assessing the patient's risk factors. Demographic characteristics of patients and GPs were obtained. Results. Data from 51 GPs and 564 patients were analysed. Patients without a history of stroke or heart disease reported significantly higher rates of smoking (12\%) and risky alcohol consumption (56\%) than patients with a history of stroke or heart disease (6\% and 36\%, respectively). Low sensitivity of GP detection of risk factors was found for all risk factors for all patients. Patients with a history of stroke or heart disease have a significantly higher mean proportion of risk factors detected by their GP compared to patients without a history of stroke or heart disease (P = 0.00). Conclusion. Given low sensitivity and specificity of GP detection of risk factors among patients, alternate methods of identification are needed. Research is required to determine strategies to facilitate secondary care of patients with a history of stroke or heart disease by GPs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease and cancer are leading causes of mortality for people with a history of alcohol or other substance use disorders. These chronic diseases share the same four primary behavioural risk factors i.e. excessive alcohol use, smoking, low intake of fruit and vegetables and physical inactivity. In addition to addressing problematic alcohol use, there is the potential for substance abuse treatment services to also address these other behaviours. Healthy Recovery is an 8-session group-based intervention that targets these multiple behavioural health risk factors and was developed specifically for people attending substance abuse treatment. This protocol describes a Cancer Institute NSW funded study that assesses the effectiveness of delivering Healthy Recovery for people who are attending residential alcohol and other substance abuse treatment. METHODS/DESIGN: The study uses a stepped wedge randomised controlled design, where randomisation occurs at the service level. Participants will be recruited from residential rehabilitation programs provided by The Australian Salvation Army. All participants who (1) currently smoke tobacco and (2) are expected to be in the residential program for the duration of the 5-week intervention will be asked to participate in the study. Those participants residing at the facilities assigned to the treatment condition will complete Healthy Recovery. The intervention is manual guided and will be delivered over a 5-week period, with participants attending 8 group sessions. All participants will continue to complete The Salvation Army residential program, a predominantly 12-step based, modified therapeutic community. Participants in the control condition will complete treatment as usual. Research staff blind to treatment allocation will complete the primary and secondary outcome assessments at baseline and then at weeks 8, 20 and 32 weeks post intervention. DISCUSSION: This study will provide comprehensive data on the effect of delivering a healthy lifestyle intervention (i.e. Healthy Recovery) within a residential substance abuse setting. If shown to be effective, this intervention can be disseminated within other residential substance abuse programs.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Answering clinical questions arising from patient care can improve that care and offers an opportunity for adult learning. It is also a vital component in practising evidence-based medicine. GPs' sources of in-consultation information can be human or non-human (either hard copy or electronic). OBJECTIVES: To establish the prevalence and associations of GP trainees' in-consultation information-seeking, and to establish the prevalence of use of different sources of information (human, hard copy and electronic) and the associations of choosing particular sources. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of data (2010-13) from an ongoing cohort study of Australian GP trainees' consultations. Once each 6-month training term, trainees record detailed data of 60 consecutive consultations. The primary outcome was whether the trainee sought in-consultation information for a problem/diagnosis. Secondary outcomes were whether information-seeking was from a human (GP, other specialist or other health professional) or from a non-human source (electronic or hard copy), and whether a non-human source was electronic or hard copy. RESULTS: Six hundred forty-five trainees (response rate 94.3\%) contributed data for 84 723 consultations including 131 583 problems/diagnoses. In-consultation information was sought for 15.4\% (95\% confidence interval = 15.3-15.6) of problems/diagnoses. Sources were: GP in 6.9\% of problems/diagnoses, other specialists 0.9\%, other health professionals 0.6\%, electronic sources 6.5\% and hard-copy sources 1.5\%. Associations of information-seeking included younger patient age, trainee full-time status and earlier training stage, longer consultation duration, referring the patient, organizing follow-up and generating learning goals. Associations of choosing human information sources (over non-human sources) were similar, but also included the trainee's training organization. Associations of electronic rather than hard-copy information-seeking included the trainee being younger, the training organization and information-seeking for management rather than diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Trainee information-seeking is mainly from GP colleagues and electronic sources. Human information-sources are preferentially sought for more complex problems, even by these early-career GPs who have trained in the 'internet era'.},

  abstract = {© 2015 American Academy of Pain Medicine. Objective: With escalating opioid prescribing come individual and public health harms. To inform quality improvement measures, understanding of opioid prescribing is essential. We aimed to establish consultation-level prevalence and associations of opioid prescribing. Design: A cross-sectional secondary analysis from a longitudinal multisite cohort study of general practitioner (GP) vocational trainees: "Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training." Setting: Four of Australia's seventeen GP Regional Training Providers, during 2010-13. Subjects: GP trainees. Methods: Practice and trainee demographic data were collected as well as patient, clinical and educational data of 60 consecutive consultations of each trainee, each training term. Outcome factors were any opioid analgesic prescription and initial opioid analgesic prescription for a specific problem for the first time. Results: Overall, 645 trainees participated. Opioids comprised 4.3\% prescriptions provided for 3.8\% of patients. Most frequently prescribed were codeine (39.9\%) and oxycodone (33.4\%). Prescribing was for acute pain (29.3\%), palliative care (2.6\%) or other indications (68.1\%). Most prescribing involved repeat prescriptions for pre-existing problems (62.7\% of total). Other associations included older patients; prescriber and patient male gender; Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander status; rural and disadvantaged locations; longer consultations; and generation of referrals, follow-up, and imaging requests. Opioid initiation was more likely for new patients with new problems, but otherwise associations were similar. Trainees rarely reported addiction risk-mitigation strategies. Conclusions: Most opioids were prescribed as maintenance therapy for non-cancer pain. Demographic associations with opioid analgesic prescribing resemble those presenting for opioid dependency treatment. Our findings should inform measures by regulators and medical educators supporting multimodal pain management.},

Objective: There is a growing body of literature examining the clustering of health risk behaviours, but little consensus about which risk factors can be expected to cluster for which sub groups of people. This systematic review aimed to examine the international literature on the clustering of smoking, poor nutrition, excess alcohol and physical inactivity (SNAP) health behaviours among adults, including associated socio-demographic variables. Method: A literature search was conducted in May 2014. Studies examining at least two SNAP risk factors, and using a cluster or factor analysis technique, or comparing observed to expected prevalence of risk factor combinations, were included. Results: Fifty-six relevant studies were identified. A majority of studies (81\%) reported a 'healthy' cluster characterised by the absence of any SNAP risk factors. More than half of the studies reported a clustering of alcohol with smoking, and half reported clustering of all four SNAP risk factors. The methodological quality of included studies was generally weak to moderate. Males and those with greater social disadvantage showed riskier patterns of behaviours; younger age was less clearly associated with riskier behaviours. Conclusion: Clustering patterns reported here reinforce the need for health promotion interventions to target multiple behaviours, and for such efforts to be specifically designed and accessible for males and those who are socially disadvantaged.},

  abstract = {Objective: Previous tuberculosis (TB) treatment status is an established risk factor for multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). This study explores which factors related to previous TB treatment may lead to the development of multidrug resistant in Bangladesh. Design: We previously conducted a large case- control study to identify risk factors for developing MDR-TB in Bangladesh. Patients who had a history of previous TB treatment, either MDR-TB or non-MDRTB, were interviewed about their previous treatment episode. This study restricts analysis to the strata of patients who have been previously treated for TB. Information was collected through face-to-face interviews and record reviews. Unadjusted and multivariable logistic regression was used for data analysis. Setting: Central-level, district-level and subdistrict-level hospitals in rural and urban Bangladesh. Results: The strata of previously treated patients include a total of 293 patients (245 current MDR-TB; 48 non-MDR-TB). Overall, 54\% of patients received previous TB treatment more than once, and all of these patients were multidrug resistant. Patients with MDR-TB were more likely to have experienced the following factors: incomplete treatment (OR 4.3; 95\% CI 1.7 to 10.6), adverse reactions due to TB treatment (OR 8.2; 95\% CI 3.2 to 20.7), hospitalisation for symptoms associated with TB (OR 16.9; CI 1.8 to 156.2), DOTS (directly observed treatment, shortcourse) centre as treatment unit (OR 6.4; CI 1.8 to 22.8), supervised treatment (OR 3.8; CI 1.6 to 9.5); time-to-treatment centre (OR 0.984; CI 0.974 to 0.993). Conclusions: Incomplete treatment, hospitalisation for TB treatment and adverse reaction are the factors related to previous TB treatment of patients with MDR-TB. Although the presence of supervised treatment (DOT), less time-to-treatment centres and being treated in DOTS centres were relatively higher among the patients with MDR-TB compared with patients without MDR-TB, these findings include information of their most recent TB treatment episode only. Most (64.5\%) of the patients with MDR-TB had received TB treatment more than once.},

These conditions peak in young adulthood, and commonly co-occur. Comorbid depression and binge drinking are undertreated in young people, who are reluctant to seek help via traditional pathways to care. The iTreAD project (internet Treatment for Alcohol and Depression) aims to provide and evaluate internet-delivered monitoring and treatment programs for young people with depression and binge drinking concerns. Methods: Three hundred sixty nine participants will be recruited to the trial, and will be aged 18-30 years will be eligible for the study if they report current symptoms of depression (score 5 or more on the depression subscale of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) and concurrent binge drinking practices (5 or more standard drinks at least twice in the prior month). Following screening and online baseline assessment, participants are randomised to: (a) online monthly self-assessments, (b) online monthly self-assessments∈+∈12-months of access to a 4 week online automated cognitive behaviour therapy program for binge drinking and depression (DEAL); or (c) online monthly assessment∈+∈DEAL∈+∈12-months of access to a social networking site (Breathing Space). Independent, blind follow-up assessments occur at 26, 39, 52 and 64-weeks post-baseline. Discussion: The iTreAD project is the first randomised controlled trial combining online cognitive behaviour therapy, social networking and online monitoring for young people reporting concerns with depression and binge drinking. These treatments represent low-cost, wide-reach youth-appropriate treatment, which will have significantly public health implications for service design, delivery and health policy for this important age group.

Design: A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) cohort study. Setting: Five of Australia's 17 general practice regional training providers, encompassing urban-tovery remote practices. Participants: GP trainees. Main Outcome Measure(s): The number of pathology tests ordered per problem/diagnosis managed. Results: A total of 856 individual trainees (response rate 95.2\%) contributed data from 1832 traineeterms, 108 759 encounters and 169 304 problems. Pathology test-ordering prevalence was 79.3 tests (95\% CI: 78.8-79.8) per 100 encounters, 50.9 (95\% CI: 50.6-51.3) per 100 problems, and at least 1 test was requested in 22.4\% of consultations. Most commonly ordered was full blood count (6.1 per 100 problems). The commonest problem prompting test-ordering was 'check-up' (18.6\%). Test-ordering was significantly associated, on multivariable analysis, with the trainee having worked at the practice previously; the patient being adult, male and new to both trainee and practice; the practice being urban; the problem/diagnosis being new; imaging being ordered; referral being made and followup being arranged. Trainees were significantly less likely to order tests for problems/diagnoses for which they had sought in-consultation information or advice. Conclusions: Compared with the established GPs, trainees order more pathology tests per consultation and per problem managed, and in a higher proportion of consultations. Our findings will inform educational policy to enhance quality and safety in general practice training.},

To improve community health, the production of such reviews should align with burden of disease. This study aims to assess if the volume of research output from systematic reviews proportionally aligns with burden of disease assessed using percentages of mortality and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). Methods: A cross-sectional audit of reviews published between January 2012 and August 2013 in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) and Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) was undertaken. Percentages of mortality and DALYs were obtained from the 2010 Global Burden of Disease study. Standardised residual differences (SRD) based on percentages of mortality and DALYs were calculated, where conditions with SRD of more than or less than three were considered overstudied or understudied, respectively. Results: 1029 reviews from CDSR and 1928 reviews from DARE were examined. There was a significant correlation between percentage DALYs and systematic reviews published in CDSR and DARE databases (CDSR: r=0.68, p=0.001; DARE: r=0.60, p{\textless}0.001). There was no significant correlation between percentage mortality and number of systematic reviews published in either database (CDSR: r=0.34, p=0.14; DARE: r=0.22, p=0.34). Relative to percentage of mortality, mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal conditions and other non-communicable diseases were overstudied. Maternal disorders were overstudied relative to percentages of mortality and DALYs in CDSR. Conclusions: The focus of systematic reviews is moderately correlated with DALYs. A number of conditions may be overstudied relative to percentage of mortality particularly in the context of health and medical reviews.},

Here, we determine the association between the presence of a panel of autoantibodies at baseline and change in depression symptom score over 5-year follow-up in a cohort of healthy elderly Australians. METHODS: Serum samples from 2049 randomly selected subjects enrolled in the Hunter Community Study (HCS) aged 55-85 years were assayed for a range of autoimmune markers (anti-nuclear autoantibodies, extractable nuclear antigen autoantibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies, thyroid peroxidase autoantibodies, tissue transglutaminase autoantibodies, anti-cardiolipin autoantibodies, rheumatoid factor and cyclic citrullinated peptide autoantibodies) at baseline. Depression symptom score was assessed using the Centre for Epidemiological Study (CES-D) scale at baseline and 5 years later. RESULTS: Autoantibody prevalence varied amongst our sample with ANA being the most prevalent; positive in 16\% and borderline in 36\% of study population. No evidence for a relationship was found between change in CES-D score over time and any autoimmune marker. Statins and high cholesterol were significantly associated with change in CES-D score over time in univariate analysis; however, these were probably confounded since they failed to remain significant following multivariable analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Autoantibodies were not associated with change in CES-D score over time. These findings point to an absence of autoimmune mechanisms in the general population or in moderate cases of depression.},

  abstract = {© 2015, American Aging Association. Hand grip strength (GS) is a predictor of mortality in older adults and is moderately to highly heritable, but no genetic variants have been consistently identified. We aimed to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with GS in middle-aged to older adults using a genome-wide association study (GWAS). GS was measured using handheld dynamometry in community-dwelling men and women aged 55–85 from the Hunter Community Study (HCS, N = 2088) and the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (Sydney MAS, N = 541). Genotyping was undertaken using Affymetrix microarrays with imputation to HapMap2. Analyses were performed using linear regression. No genome-wide significant results were observed in HCS nor were any of the top signals replicated in Sydney MAS. Gene-based analyses in HCS identified two significant genes (ZNF295, C2CD2), but these results were not replicated in Sydney MAS. One out of eight SNPs previously associated with GS, rs550942, located near the CNTF gene, was significantly associated with GS (p = 0.005) in the HCS cohort only. Study differences may explain the lack of consistent results between the studies, including the smaller sample size of the Sydney MAS cohort. Our modest sample size also had limited power to identify variants of small effect. Our results suggest that similar to various other complex traits, many genetic variants of small effect size may influence GS. Future GWAS using larger samples and consistent measures may prove more fruitful at identifying genetic contributors for GS in middle-aged to older adults.},

In breast cancer, TrkA contributes to metastasis but the clinicopathological significance remains unclear. In this study, TrkA expression was assessed via immunohistochemistry of 158 invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC), 158 invasive lobular carcinomas (ILC) and 50 ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS). TrkA was expressed in cancer epithelial and myoepithelial cells, with higher levels of TrkA positively associated with IDC (39\% of cases) (p {\textless} 0.0001). Interestingly, TrkA was significantly increased in tumours expressing the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), with expression in 49\% of HER2-positive compared to 25\% of HER2-negative tumours (p = 0.0027). A panel of breast cancer cells were used to confirm TrkA protein expression, demonstrating higher levels of TrkA (total and phosphorylated) in HER2-positive cell lines. Functional investigations using four different HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines indicated that the Trk tyrosine kinase inhibitor GNF-5837 reduced cell viability, through decreased phospho-TrkA (Tyr490) and downstream AKT (Ser473) activation, but did not display synergy with Herceptin. Overall, these data highlight a relationship between the tyrosine kinase receptors TrkA and HER2 and suggest the potential of TrkA as a novel or adjunct target for HER2-positive breast tumours.},

  abstract = {Background
Bangladesh is one of the 27 high burden countries for multidrug resistant tuberculosis listed by the World Health Organization. Delay in multidrug resistant tuberculosis treatment may allow progression of the disease and affect the attempts to curb transmission of drug resistant tuberculosis. The main objective of this study was to investigate the health system delay in multidrug resistant tuberculosis treatment in Bangladesh and to explore the factors related to the delay.

Methods
Information related to the delay was collected as part of a previously conducted case–control study. The current study restricts analysis to patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis who were diagnosed using rapid diagnostic methods (Xpert MTB/RIF or the line probe assay). Information was collected by face-to-face interviews and through record reviews from all three Government hospitals providing multidrug resistant tuberculosis services, from September 2012 to April 2013. Multivariable regression analysis was performed using Bootstrap variance estimators. Definitions were as follows: Provider delay: time between visiting a provider for first consultation on MDR-TB related symptom to visiting a designated diagnostic centre for testing; Diagnostic delay: time from date of diagnostic sample provided to date of result; Treatment initiation delay: time between the date of diagnosis and date of treatment initiation; Health system delay: time between visiting a provider to start of treatment. Health system delay was derived by adding provider delay, diagnostic delay and treatment initiation delay.

Results
The 207 multidrug resistant tuberculosis patients experienced a health system delay of median 7.1 weeks. The health system delay consists of provider delay (median 4 weeks), diagnostic delay (median 5 days) and treatment initiation delay (median 10 days). Health system delay (Coefficient: 37.7; 95 \%; CI 15.0–60.4; p 0.003) was associated with the visit to private practitioners for first consultation.

Conclusions
Diagnosis time for multidrug resistant tuberculosis was fast using the rapid tests. However, some degree of delay was present in treatment initiation, after diagnosis. The most effective way to reduce health system delay would be through strategies such as engaging private practitioners in multidrug resistant tuberculosis control.},

  abstract = {© 2015 Diabetes UK. Aims: To characterize the association with Type 2 diabetes of known Type 2 diabetes risk variants in people in Malaysia of Malay, Chinese and Indian ancestry who participated in the Malaysian Cohort project. Methods: We genotyped 1604 people of Malay ancestry (722 cases, 882 controls), 1654 of Chinese ancestry (819 cases, 835 controls) and 1728 of Indian ancestry (851 cases, 877 controls). First, 62 candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously associated with Type 2 diabetes were assessed for association via logistic regression within ancestral groups and then across ancestral groups using a meta-analysis. Second, estimated odds ratios were assessed for excess directional concordance with previously studied populations. Third, a genetic risk score aggregating allele dosage across the candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms was tested for association within and across ancestral groups. Results: After Bonferroni correction, seven individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with Type 2 diabetes in the combined Malaysian sample. We observed a highly significant excess in concordance of effect directions between Malaysian and previously studied populations. The genetic risk score was strongly associated with Type 2 diabetes in all Malaysian groups, explaining from 1.0 to 1.7\% of total Type 2 diabetes risk variance. Conclusion: This study suggests there is substantial overlap of the genetic risk alleles underlying Type 2 diabetes in Malaysian and other populations. What's new?: This is the first large-scale genetic study of Type 2 diabetes in a Malaysian population. We assessed 62 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with Type 2 diabetes for their association with the disease in 2392 patients with Type 2 diabetes and 2594 control subjects of Malay, Chinese and Indian ancestry. Seven individual SNPs were associated with Type 2 diabetes after multiple testing adjustment. We observed highly significant excess in concordance of allelic effect directions between Malaysian and previously studied populations (P = 1 x 10-8). A genetic risk score including the 62 SNPs showed strong association in the Malaysian sample (P = 2 x 10-16) and explained 1.0-1.7\% of disease variance},

Objective: General practice is central to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health care, and this area is a core element of Australian general practice (GP) training. We aimed to describe the prevalence, nature and associations of GP registrar encounters with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients. Methods: A cross-sectional analysis from a cohort study of GP registrars' clinical consultations 2010-2013. Registrars record demographic, clinical and educational details of consecutive patient encounters. Multivariable associations were tested with logistic regression. Results: A total of 592 registrars contributed data from 69,188 consultations. Encounters with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients comprised 1.0\% of consultations. Significant positive associations included younger patient age; new patient to the registrar; lower socioeconomic status of practice location; non-urban practice setting; more problems managed; and follow-up arranged. A greater proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients' problems were psychological/social and a lesser proportion were cardiovascular. Consultation duration did not differ between the two groups Conclusions: GP registrars encounter Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients less than do established GPs. Our results suggest possible variability in registrar experience of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health. Implications: Our findings will inform training of a culturally and clinically competent workforce in this area.},

We undertook a genome-wide association study of ApoH levels using the largest sample to date and replicated the results in an independent cohort (total N = 1,255). In the discovery phase, a meta-analysis of two cohorts, the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (Sydney MAS) and the Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) (n = 942) revealed genome-wide significant results in or near the APOH gene on chromosome 17 (top SNP, rs7211380, p = 1 × 10-11). The results were replicated in an independent cohort, the Hunter Community Study (p {\textless} 0.002) (n = 313). Conditional and joint analysis (COJO) confirmed the association of the chromosomal 17 region with ApoH levels. The set of independent SNPs identified by COJO explained 23\% of the variance. The relationships between the top SNPs and cardiovascular/lipid/cognition measures and diabetes were assessed in Sydney MAS, with suggestive results observed for diabetes and cognitive performance. However, replication of these results in the smaller OATS cohort was not found. This work provides impetus for future research to better understand the contribution of genetics to ApoH levels and its possible impacts on health.},

  abstract = {© 2014 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd Studies have identified prenatal flavour exposure as a determinant of taste preferences in infants; however, these studies have focused on relatively small samples and limited flavours. As many parents struggle with getting children to accept a variety of nutritious foods, a study of the factors influencing food acceptance is warranted. The objective of this study was to determine whether exposure to a wider variety of fruit and vegetables and overall higher diet quality in utero results in acceptance of a greater variety of these foods and better diet quality for offspring during childhood. This study is a secondary data analysis of pregnant women (n = 52) and their resulting offspring recruited for the Women and Their Children's Health study in NSW, Australia. Dietary intake of mothers and children was measured using food frequency questionnaires. Diet quality and vegetable and fruit variety were calculated using the Australian Recommended Food Score and the Australian Child and Adolescent Recommended Food Score. Associations between maternal and child diet quality and variety were assessed using Pearson's correlations and the total effect of in utero maternal pregnancy diet on childhood diet was decomposed into direct and indirect effect using mediation analysis. Maternal pregnancy and post-natal diet were both correlated with child diet for overall diet quality and fruit and vegetable variety (P {\textless} 0.001). Mediation analyses showed that the indirect effect of maternal pregnancy diet on child diet was mediated through maternal post-natal diet, particularly for fruit (P = 0.045) and vegetables (P = 0.055). Nutrition intervention should therefore be aimed at improving diet quality and variety in mothers with young children, in order to subsequently improve eating habits of offspring.},

To identify common variants contributing to normal variation in two specific domains of cognitive functioning, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of executive functioning and information processing speed in non-demented older adults from the CHARGE (Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology) consortium. Neuropsychological testing was available for 5429-32 070 subjects of European ancestry aged 45 years or older, free of dementia and clinical stroke at the time of cognitive testing from 20 cohorts in the discovery phase. We analyzed performance on the Trail Making Test parts A and B, the Letter Digit Substitution Test (LDST), the Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST), semantic and phonemic fluency tests, and the Stroop Color and Word Test. Replication was sought in 1311-21860 subjects from 20 independent cohorts. A significant association was observed in the discovery cohorts for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs17518584 (discovery P-value=3.12 × 10 -8) and in the joint discovery and replication meta-analysis (P-value=3.28 × 10 -9 after adjustment for age, gender and education) in an intron of the gene cell adhesion molecule 2 (CADM2) for performance on the LDST/DSST. Rs17518584 is located about 170 kb upstream of the transcription start site of the major transcript for the CADM2 gene, but is within an intron of a variant transcript that includes an alternative first exon. The variant is associated with expression of CADM2 in the cingulate cortex (P-value=4 × 10 -4). The protein encoded by CADM2 is involved in glutamate signaling (P-value=7.22 × 10 -15), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transport (P-value=1.36 × 10 -11) and neuron cell-cell adhesion (P-value=1.48 × 10 -13).

  abstract = {© AHHA 2016. Objective To establish prevalence and associations of general practice nurses' (GPNs) involvement in general practitioner (GP) registrars' consultations. Methods A cross-sectional analysis from an ongoing cohort study of registrars' clinical consultations in five Australian states. Registrars recorded detailed data from 60 consecutive consultations per 6-month training term. Problems and diagnoses encountered, including chronic disease classification, were coded using the International Classification of Primary Care, second edition duplication system (ICPC-2plus) classification system. The outcome factor in our analysis was GPN involvement in management of individual problems and diagnoses. Independent variables were a range of patient, registrar, practice, consultation and educational factors. Results We analysed 108759 consultations of 856 registrars including 169307 problems or diagnoses. Of the problems/diagnoses, 5.1\% (95\% confidence interval (CI) 5.0-5.2) involved a GPN. Follow-up with a GPN was organised for 1.5\% (95\% CI 1.4-1.5) of all problems/diagnoses. Significant associations of GPN involvement included patient age, male sex, Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status, non-English-speaking background (NESB) and the patient being new to the practice. Larger practice size, the particular training organisation, and the problem/diagnosis being new and not a chronic disease were other associations. Conclusions Associations with Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status and NESB status suggest GPNs are addressing healthcare needs of these under-serviced groups. But GPNs may be underutilised in chronic disease care. What is known about this topic? GPNs are increasingly involved in team-based care in Australian general practice. The potential positive contribution of GPNs to general practice teams is acknowledged, but the role of the GPN is still being refined. What does this paper add? GPNs contribute to the care of a modest proportion of patients seen by GP registrars. Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander status and NESB of patients are positively associated with being seen by a GPN; chronic disease is negatively associated with being seen by a GPN. There is geographic variability in prevalence of GPN consultations, not explained by other factors. What are the implications for practitioners? Given the match of GPN skills and attributes to the needs of patients with chronic diseases, GPNs currently may be underutilised in chronic disease care in Australian general practice. The marked geographic variation in uptake of GPNs also suggests scope for greater utilisation of GPNs Australia-wide.},

  abstract = {© 2016 Kay-Lambkin et al. Background: People with bipolar disorder (BD) have a mortality gap of up to 20 years compared to the general population. Physical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, cause the majority of excess deaths in psychiatric populations and are the leading causes of mortality in people with BD. However, comparatively little attention has been paid to reducing the risk of physical conditions in psychiatric populations. Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are among the potentially modifiable risk factors for a range of commonly comorbid chronic medical conditions, including CVD, diabetes, and obesity. This systematic review will identify and evaluate the available evidence for effective interventions to reduce risk and promote healthy lifestyle behaviors in BD. Methods/design: We will search MEDLINE, Embase, PsychINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL for published research studies (with at least an abstract published in English) that evaluate behavioral or psychosocial interventions to address the following lifestyle factors in people with BD: tobacco use, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet, overweight or obesity, sleep-wake disturbance, and alcohol/other drug use. Primary outcomes for the review will be changes in tobacco use, level of physical activity, diet quality, sleep quality, alcohol use, and illicit drug use. Data on each primary outcome will be synthesized across available studies in that lifestyle area (e.g., tobacco abstinence, cigarettes smoked per day), and panel of research and clinical experts in each of the target lifestyle behaviors and those experienced with clinical and research with individuals with BD will determine how best to represent data related to that primary outcome. Seven members of the systematic review team will extract data, synthesize the evidence, and rate it for quality. Evidence will be synthesized via a narrative description of the behavioral interventions and their effectiveness in improving the healthy lifestyle behaviors in people with BD. Discussion: The planned review will synthesize and evaluate the available evidence regarding the behavioral or psychosocial treatment of lifestyle-related behaviors in people with BD. From this review, we will identify gaps in our existing knowledge and research evidence about the management of unhealthy lifestyle behaviors in people with BD. We will also identify potential opportunities to address lifestyle behaviors in BD, with a view to reducing the burden of physical ill-health in this population.

Objectives: To document the frequency of recording of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status in general practice (GP) clinical records and to establish associations of this recording. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis of recording of patients' Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status in GP clinical records from GP training practices in four Australian states. Results: Of the 9,704 clinical records examined, the patients' Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status had been documented in 5,165 (53.2\%). Higher rates of recording were associated with older patient age, practices outside a major city, patients who were not new to the practice and the patient being Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander. In encounters with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients, the patient's status had been documented in 82\% of records. Those attending larger practices were less likely to have had their status recorded. Conclusions: This is the first report of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status recording in GP clinical records. Almost 20\% of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients did not have their status recorded in the clinical record, with indications that recording may be unsystematic. Implications: Our findings reinforce the need for a systematic approach to identification of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status in general practice and will inform policy and practice in this important area.},

  abstract = {© 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. An investigation of beliefs used to rationalise smoking will have important implications for the content of anti-smoking programs targeted at socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, who show the lowest rates of cessation in the population. This study aimed to assess the types of self-exempting beliefs reported by a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers, and identify associations between these beliefs and other smoking-related factors with quit intentions. A cross-sectional survey was conducted from March–December 2012 with smokers seeking welfare assistance in New South Wales (NSW), Australia (n = 354; response rate 79\%). Responses to a 16-item self-exempting beliefs scale and intention to quit, smoker identity, and enjoyment of smoking were assessed. Most participants earned {\textless} AUD\$400/week (70\%), and had not completed secondary schooling (64\%). All “jungle” beliefs (normalising the dangers of smoking due to ubiquity of risk) and selected “skeptic” beliefs were endorsed by 25\%–47\% of the sample, indicating these smokers may not fully understand the extensive risks associated with smoking. Smokers w ith limited quit intentions held significantly stronger self-exempting beliefs than those contemplating or preparing to quit (all p {\textless} 0.01). After adjusting for smoking-related variables only “skeptic” beliefs were significantly associated with intention to quit (p = 0.02). Some of these beliefs are incorrect and could be addressed in anti-smoking campaigns.},

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited. Background Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is an important predictor of all-cause mortality in the absence of chronic respiratory conditions. Epidemiological evidence highlights the role of early life factors on adult FVC, pointing to environmental exposures and genes affecting lung development as risk factors for low FVC later in life. Although highly heritable, a small number of genes have been found associated with FVC, and we aimed at identifying further genetic variants by focusing on lung development genes. Methods Per-allele effects of 24,728 SNPs in 403 genes involved in lung development were tested in 7,749 adults from three studies (NFBC1966, ECRHS, EGEA). The most significant SNP for the top 25 genes was followed-up in 46,103 adults (CHARGE and SpiroMeta consortia) and 5,062 children (ALSPAC). Associations were considered replicated if the replication p-value survived Bonferroni correction (p{\textless}0.002; 0.05/25), with a nominal p-value considered as suggestive evidence. For SNPs with evidence of replication, effects on the expression levels of nearby genes in lung tissue were tested in 1,111 lung samples (Lung eQTL consortium), with further functional investigation performed using public epigenomic profiling data (ENCODE). Results NCOR2-rs12708369 showed strong replication in children (p = 0.0002), with replication unavailable in adults due to low imputation quality. This intronic variant is in a strong transcriptional enhancer element in lung fibroblasts, but its eQTL effects could not be tested due to low imputation quality in the eQTL dataset. SERPINE2-rs6754561 replicated at nominal level in both adults (p = 0.036) and children (p = 0.045), while WNT16-rs2707469 replicated at nominal level only in adults (p = 0.026). The eQTL analyses showed association of WNT16-rs2707469 with expression levels of the nearby gene CPED1.We found no statistically significant eQTL effects for SERPINE2-rs6754561. Conclusions We have identified a new gene, NCOR2, in the retinoic acid signalling pathway pointing to a role of Vitamin A metabolism in the regulation of FVC. Our findings also support SERPINE2, a COPD gene with weak previous evidence of association with FVC, and suggest WNT16 as a further promising candidate.},

  abstract = {© The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. Background: Acute sore throat is a common condition presenting to family practitioners. It is usually self-limiting, with antibiotic treatment recommended only for high-risk presentations. Overprescribing of antibiotics contributes to individual and community resistance. Learning to prescribe in the context of diagnostic uncertainty and patient pressures is a challenge for early-career doctors. Prescribing habits develop early and tend not to change with time. Objective: To establish the prevalence and associations of antibiotic prescribing for acute sore throat by Australian vocational trainees in family practice. Method: A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study. This ongoing, multicentre prospective cohort study documents the nature of trainees' consultation-based clinical experiences. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted on data recorded in consultations for sore throat in nine collection periods during 2010-14. Results: Data from 856 individual trainees (response rate 95.2\%) were analysed. Sore throat was managed in 2.3\% encounters. Antibiotics were prescribed for 71.5\% of sore throat diagnoses. The variables associated with prescribing were inner-regional location and higher socio-economic area. There was no significant association with younger age of patient or greater trainee experience. If an antibiotic was prescribed, the trainee was more likely to seek information from guidelines or a supervisor. Conclusions: The high frequency of antibiotic prescribing and the lack of attenuation in prescribing with increased experience suggest current educational interventions and the apprenticeship model of training is not fostering appropriate practice in this important clinical area. Targeted educational interventions, for supervisors as well as trainees, are indicated.},

Elevations in postmortem vitreous sodium chloride (PMVSC) levels may help in differentiating saltwater/seawater drowning (SWD) deaths from immersion deaths not related to drowning (DNRD). It is unclear whether the elevation is related to blood/plasma electrolyte changes after inhalation of seawater as hypothesized in SWDs or possibly caused by electrolyte diffusion and/or osmosis across the outer coats of the eyeball during immersion. Aim: To investigate the changes in bovine PMVSC levels at different time points while immersed in seawater. Methods: Bovine eyeballs were obtained from an abattoir and randomized into 2 groups: A) submerged in seawater ("wet" group) or b) placed in an impermeable plastic bag that was immersed in seawater ("dry" group). The PMVSC levels from 6 eyeballs were measured from each group (without replacement) at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, and 12 hours. Results: There was no significant difference in mean PMVSC levels between the 2 groups at 30-minute and 1-hour intervals. A significant difference was noted from 6 hours onward. Discussion: There is no statistically significant elevation in bovine PMVSC levels when immersed in seawater for up to 1 hour. Assuming similar physical properties in humans, any elevations in PMVSC levels in bodies immersed in seawater for less than 1 hour should not be caused by immersion.},

Purpose This cross-sectional study assessed the association between oncology outpatients' quality improvement preferences and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Implementation of specific initiatives preferred by patients with lower HRQoL may be a strategic approach to enhancing care for potentially vulnerable patients. Methods English-speaking adults were recruited from five outpatient chemotherapy clinics located in New South Wales, Australia. Using touch screen devices, participants selected up to 25 initiatives that would improve their experiences and completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) survey. The logistic odds of selecting an initiative according to FACT-G scores were calculated to determine whether preferences were associated with HRQoL after controlling for potential confounders. Results Of the 411 eligible outpatients approached to participate, 263 (64\%) completed surveys. Commonly selected initiatives were up-to-date information on treatment and condition progress (19.8\%), access to or information on financial assistance (18.3\%), and reduced clinic wait times (17.5\%). For those with relatively lower FACT-G scores, the adjusted odds of selecting five initiatives illustrated an increasing trend: convenient appointment scheduling systems (+23\% [P =.002]), reduced wait times (+15\% [P =.01]), information on medical emergencies (+14\% [P =.04]), access to or information on financial assistance (+15\% [P =.009]), help to maintain daily living activities (+18\% [P =.007]). Conclusion Two areas of improvement were commonly selected: easily accessible health services and information and support for self-management. Although the results suggest an association between a few quality improvement preferences and HRQoL, a wider spectrum of patient characteristics must be considered when targeting quality improvement to patient subgroups.},

  abstract = {© 2016 Nature America, Inc. Very few genetic variants have been associated with depression and neuroticism, likely because of limitations on sample size in previous studies. Subjective well-being, a phenotype that is genetically correlated with both of these traits, has not yet been studied with genome-wide data. We conducted genome-wide association studies of three phenotypes: subjective well-being (n = 298,420), depressive symptoms (n = 161,460), and neuroticism (n = 170,911). We identify 3 variants associated with subjective well-being, 2 variants associated with depressive symptoms, and 11 variants associated with neuroticism, including 2 inversion polymorphisms. The two loci associated with depressive symptoms replicate in an independent depression sample. Joint analyses that exploit the high genetic correlations between the phenotypes (P = 0.8) strengthen the overall credibility of the findings and allow us to identify additional variants. Across our phenotypes, loci regulating expression in central nervous system and adrenal or pancreas tissues are strongly enriched for association.},

  abstract = {© 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited. Educational attainment is strongly influenced by social and other environmental factors, but genetic factors are estimated to account for at least 20\% of the variation across individuals. Here we report the results of a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for educational attainment that extends our earlier discovery sample of 101,069 individuals to 293,723 individuals, and a replication study in an independent sample of 111,349 individuals from the UK Biobank. We identify 74 genome-wide significant loci associated with the number of years of schooling completed. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with educational attainment are disproportionately found in genomic regions regulating gene expression in the fetal brain. Candidate genes are preferentially expressed in neural tissue, especially during the prenatal period, and enriched for biological pathways involved in neural development. Our findings demonstrate that, even for a behavioural phenotype that is mostly environmentally determined, a well-powered GWAS identifies replicable associated genetic variants that suggest biologically relevant pathways. Because educational attainment is measured in large numbers of individuals, it will continue to be useful as a proxy phenotype in efforts to characterize the genetic influences of related phenotypes, including cognition and neuropsychiatric diseases.},

These can vary from urban to rural areas, survival period and according to the type of cancer. We here aimed to describe demographics and psychosocial analysis of cancer survivors three to five years post-treatment in rural Australia and also assess relationships with financial stress and quality of life domains. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 65 participants visiting the outpatient oncology clinic were given a self-administered questionnaire. The inclusion criteria included three to five years post-treatment. Three domains were investigated using standardised and validated tools such as the Standard Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors Scale (QLACS) and the Personal and Household Finances (HILDA) survey. Included were demographic parameters, quality of life, treatment information and well-being. Results: There was no evidence of associations between any demographic variable and either financial stress or cancer-specific quality of life domains. Financial stress was however significantly associated with the cancerspecific quality of life domains of appearance-related concerns, family related distress, and distress related to recurrence. Conclusions: This unique study effectively points to psychosocial aspects of cancer survivors in rural regions of Australia. Although the majority of demographic characteristics were not been found to be associated with financial stress, this latter itself is significantly associated with distress related to family and cancer recurrence. This finding may be of assistance in future studies and also considering plans to fulfil unmet needs.},

It remains unclear what the underlying mechanism responsible for this change is: whether this is due to rapid electrolyte changes from salt water inhalation/ingestion during drowning or from electrolyte diffusion and/or osmosis across the outer coats of the eyeballs during immersion. A recent animal study using sacrificed bovine eyeballs immersed in salt water demonstrated no significant elevations in PMVSC when immersed for less than one hour. Assuming similar physical properties between human and bovine, we extrapolate that an elevation in PMVSC in SWD with immersion times of less than one hour (SWD-1) would not be from immersion, but from drowning. Aim Investigate whether there is an elevation in PMVSC in SWD-1. Methods Retrospective study comparing PMVSC in SWD-1 with controls from 2012 to 2015 inclusive. Results PMVSC in SWD-1 was significantly elevated compared with controls. A PMVSC of 259 mmol/L has a sensitivity, specificity and likelihood ratio of 0.9, 0.9 and 7.6, respectively. Conclusion The elevation in PMVSC in SWD-1 is due to drowning. A PMVSC of 259 mmol/L and above is a reliable ancillary test in diagnosing drowning in bodies immersed in salt water for less than one hour.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population-based registries are increasingly used to recruit patient samples for research, however, they have several limitations including low consent and participation rates, and potential selection bias. To improve access to samples for research, the utility of a new model of recruitment termed the 'Consumer Register', that allows for direct patient recruitment from hospitals, was examined. This paper reports: (i) consent rates onto the register; (ii) preferred methods and frequency of contact; and (iii) the feasibility of establishing the register, including: (a) cost per person recruited to the register; (b) the differential cost and consent rates of volunteer versus paid data collectors; and (c) participant completion rates. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in five outpatient clinics in Australia. Patients were approached by volunteers or paid data collectors and asked to complete a touch-screen electronic survey. Consenting individuals were asked to indicate their willingness and preferences for enrolment onto a research register. Descriptive statistics were used to examine patient preferences and linear regression used to model the success of volunteer versus paid data collectors. The opportunity and financial costs of establishing the register were calculated. RESULTS: A total of 1947 patients (80.6 \%) consented to complete the survey, of which, 1486 (76.3 \%) completed the questionnaire. Of the completers, the majority (69.4 \%, or 1032 participants) were willing to be listed on the register and preferred to be contacted by email (50.3 \%). Almost 39 \% of completers were willing to be contacted three or more times in a 12 month period. The annual opportunity cost of resources consumed by the register was valued at \$37,187, giving an opportunity cost per person recruited to the register of \$36. After amortising fixed costs, the annual financial outlay was \$23,004 or \$22 per person recruited to the register. Use of volunteer data collectors contributed to an annual saving of \$14,183, however paid data collectors achieved significantly higher consent rates. Successful enrolment onto the register was completed for 42 \% of the sample. CONCLUSIONS: A Consumer Register is a promising and feasible alternative to population-based registries, with the majority of participants willing to be contacted multiple times via low-resource methods such as email. There is an effectiveness/cost trade off in the use of paid versus volunteer data collectors.},

  abstract = {Educational attainment is associated with many health outcomes, including longevity. It is also known to be substantially heritable. Here, we used data from three large genetic epidemiology cohort studies (Generation Scotland, n = ∼17,000; UK Biobank, n = ∼115,000; and the Estonian Biobank, n = ∼6,000) to test whether education-linked genetic variants can predict lifespan length. We did so by using cohort members' polygenic profile score for education to predict their parents' longevity. Across the three cohorts, meta-analysis showed that a 1 SD higher polygenic education score was associated with ∼2.7\% lower mortality risk for both mothers (total n deaths = 79,702) and ∼2.4\% lower risk for fathers (total n deaths = 97,630). On average, the parents of offspring in the upper third of the polygenic score distribution lived 0.55 y longer compared with those of offspring in the lower third. Overall, these results indicate that the genetic contributions to educational attainment are useful in the prediction of human longevity.},

This study aimed to (i) describe concurrent and simultaneous tobacco and cannabis use and (ii) investigate the association between cannabis use and motivation and intentions to quit tobacco in a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2013 and 2014 with current tobacco smokers receiving aid fromtwo community service organizations in New South Wales, Australia. At least weekly cannabis use for the month prior to survey, motivation to quit tobacco and intentions to quit tobacco were measured in 369 participants (77\% consent rate). Regressions were carried out to investigate associations between weekly cannabis use and motivation and intentions to quit tobacco. Concurrent tobacco and cannabis use was reported by 19\% (n=71) of the sample and of these users, 100\% reported simultaneous use. Although regular cannabis use was significantly associated with lower motivation to quit tobacco, it was not significantly associated with intentions to quit tobacco in the next 30 days. Concurrent cannabis use is common in disadvantaged smokers andmay play a role in decreasedmotivation to quit tobacco; however, it does not appear to be associated with intentions to quit in a sample of disadvantaged smokers.},

  abstract = {© 2015 John Wiley \& Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd Objective: Retrospective continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can guide insulin pump adjustments, however, interpretation of data and recommending new pump settings is complex and subjective. We aimed to compare the safety and glycaemic profiles of children after their diabetologist or a novel algorithm (PumpTune) adjusted their insulin pump settings. Research design and methods: In a randomized cross-over trial of 22 patients aged 6–14 yr with type 1 diabetes with mean Hba1c 7.4\% (57 mmol/mol) using CSII, CGM was used over two periods each of 6.5 d to assess percentage time glucose remained within, above and below 3.9–10.0 mmol/L. Before the start of one period pump settings were adjusted by the patient's diabetologist, and before the other insulin pump settings were adjusted by PumpTune. Results: A total of 63.4\% of the sensor glucose levels were within target range with PumpTune settings and 57.4\% were within range with the clinician settings (p = 0.016). The time spent above target range with PumpTune was 26.9\% and with clinician settings was 33.5\% (p = 0.021). The time spent below target range with PumpTune was 9.7\% and with clinician settings was 9.2\% (p = 0.77). The mean number of times when a sensor glucose level {\textless}2.75 mmol/L was recorded with PumpTune settings was 2.9 compared with 3.7 with clinician settings (p = 0.39). There were no serious adverse outcomes and no difference in parent-assessed satisfaction. Conclusions: Automated insulin pump adjustment with PumpTune is feasible and warrants testing in a larger more varied population over a longer time. In this well-controlled group of children, PumpTune achieved a more favorable glucose profile.},

Objectives: To identify specific actions for patient-centred quality improvement in chronic disease outpatient settings, this study identified patients' general and specific preferences among a comprehensive suite of initiatives for change.Design and setting: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three hospital-based clinics specializing in oncology, neurology and cardiology care located in New South Wales, Australia.Participants and measures: Adult English-speaking outpatients completed the touch-screen Consumer Preferences Survey in waiting rooms or treatment areas. Participants selected up to 23 general initiatives that would improve their experience. Using adaptive branching, participants could select an additional 110 detailed initiatives and complete a relative prioritization exercise.Results: A total of 541 individuals completed the survey (71.1\% consent, 73.1\% completion). Commonly selected general initiatives, presented in order of decreasing priority (along with sample proportion), included: improved parking (60.3\%), up-to-date information provision (15.0\%), ease of clinic contact (12.9\%), access to information at home (12.8\%), convenient appointment scheduling (14.2\%), reduced wait-times (19.8\%) and information on medical emergencies (11.1\%). To address these general initiatives, 40 detailed initiatives were selected by respondents.Conclusions: Initiatives targeting service accessibility and information provision, such as parking and up-to-date information on patient prognoses and progress, were commonly selected and perceived to be of relatively greater priority. Specific preferences included the need for clinics to provide patient-designated parking in close proximity to the clinic, information on treatment progress and test results (potentially in the form of designated brief appointments or via telehealth) and comprehensive and trustworthy lists of information sources to access at home.},

  abstract = {© The Author 2016. Background: The aim of the study was to determine how much of the association between obesity, measured by body mass index (BMI), and cognition in older persons is mediated through inflammation, fasting plasma glucose, and hypertriglyceridemia. Methods: Anthropometrics, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), fasting plasma glucose, and serum triglycerides were measured in 3,256 community-dwelling individuals aged 55-85 years residing in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. Audio recorded cognitive screen (ARCS) was used to assess multiple cognitive domains. Results: Mediation analyses showed very modest but significant direct mediation effects, whereby obesity was associated with better cognitive function after adjusting for potential confounders (controlled direct effect ? 1/500 point increase in the total ARCS score per 1.0-kg/m2 increase in BMI). There were significant indirect negative mediation effects from BMI to cognition mediated through CRP, that is, increased BMI was associated with increased CRP which was associated with decreased cognition (natural indirect effect ?0.20 unit; 95\% confidence interval [CI] ?0.39, ?0.02), and through fasting plasma glucose, that is, increased BMI was associated with increased fasting plasma glucose which was associated with decreased cognition (natural indirect effect ?0.12 unit; 95\% CI ?0.24, ?0.01], but not through serum triglycerides. Conclusions: There is a weak positive association between obesity and cognitive performance in older persons, which is partially antagonized by inflammation and elevated fasting plasma glucose, but not hypertriglyceridemia. Further studies are needed to elucidate whether this is due to selection bias, or truly reflects biologically complex and counter balancing pathways involved in obesity.},

  abstract = {An increasing number of genome-wide association (GWA) studies are now using the higher resolution 1000 Genomes Project reference panel (1000G) for imputation, with the expectation that 1000G imputation will lead to the discovery of additional associated loci when compared to HapMap imputation. In order to assess the improvement of 1000G over HapMap imputation in identifying associated loci, we compared the results of GWA studies of circulating fibrinogen based on the two reference panels. Using both HapMap and 1000G imputation we performed a meta-analysis of 22 studies comprising the same 91,953 individuals. We identified six additional signals using 1000G imputation, while 29 loci were associated using both HapMap and 1000G imputation. One locus identified using HapMap imputation was not significant using 1000G imputation. The genome-wide significance threshold of 5×10-8 is based on the number of independent statistical tests using HapMap imputation, and 1000G imputation may lead to further independent tests that should be corrected for. When using a stricter Bonferroni correction for the 1000G GWA study (P-value {\textless} 2.5×10-8), the number of loci significant only using HapMap imputation increased to 4 while the number of loci significant only using 1000G decreased to 5. In conclusion, 1000G imputation enabled the identification of 20\% more loci than HapMap imputation, although the advantage of 1000G imputation became less clear when a stricter Bonferroni correction was used. More generally, our results provide insights that are applicable to the implementation of other dense reference panels that are under development.},

Aims We sought to ascertain the changes in mortality from ischaemic heart disease (IHD) from 2004 to 2010 in China as the sheer size of China's population makes disease patterns relevant globally. Methods and results Data on IHD mortality were obtained from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention National Disease Surveillance Point System, which includes 161 counties and a population of over 73 million-a representative sample of over 6\% of the entire population of China. Both crude and World Health Organization (WHO)-standardized IHD mortality increased, in both men and women and in both urban and rural locations, during the study period, demonstrating the effect of urbanization, economic growth, and epidemiological transition on cardiovascular health. WHO-standardized IHD mortality increased for rural males by 9.2\% per year (95\% CI: 6.7 - 11.7\%; P, 0.0001), and the trend was statistically significantly higher (P ¼ 0.0001) than in urban males by 6.4\% per year (95\% CI: 3 - 10\%; P ¼ 0.02). WHO-standardized IHD mortality rate increased for rural females by 7.0\% per year (95\% CI: 4.6 - 9.4\%; P, 0.0001); this was statistically significantly higher than urban females by 4.3\% per year (95\% CI: 1 - 8\%; P ¼ 0.02). The age group over 80 years showed the greatest increase in IHD mortality. Conclusions Mortality from IHD is increasing in China, in contrast to decreasing in other countries. This is largely driven by increasing IHD mortality in rural areas and subjects over 80 years old. This needs urgent attention by public health workers and policymakers.},

The QUICATOUCH program is one example of sustained clinic-level screening, assessment and referral. We examined whether this program was associated with reductions in pain or distress. Oncology outpatients completed a brief, computerised assessment using Distress and Pain Thermometers. We describe population levels of pain and distress and model pain and distress scores over 4 years of the program. 9,133 patients were screened on 26,385 occasions over 48 months (October 2007-September 2011). Pain over threshold (1/10) reduced over time, from 33\% in the first 3 months to 16\% in the final quarter of the evaluation. Distress over threshold (4/10) reduced from 28\% to 10\%. A reduction was also observed when restricted to patients screened for the first time. Our analysis demonstrated this effect was not explained by measured potential confounders (gender, age, treatment status) and was unlikely to be attributable to regression to the mean. Observational studies cannot prove causation. However, the significant reduction in pain and distress levels in the 48 months following commencement of QUICATOUCH is consistent with a beneficial effect of the program.},

Background: Halogenated anesthetics activate cardiac ryanodine receptor 2-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ release, leading to sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ depletion, reduced cardiac function, and providing cell protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury. Anesthetic activation of ryanodine receptor 2 is poorly defined, leaving aspects of the protective mechanism uncertain. Methods: Ryanodine receptor 2 from the sheep heart was incorporated into artificial lipid bilayers, and their gating properties were measured in response to five halogenated anesthetics. Results: Each anesthetic rapidly and reversibly activated ryanodine receptor 2, but only from the cytoplasmic side. Relative activation levels were as follows: halothane (approximately 4-fold; n = 8), desflurane and enflurane (approximately 3-fold,n = 9), and isoflurane and sevoflurane (approximately 1.5-fold, n = 7, 10). Half-activating concentrations (K a) were in the range 1.3 to 2.1 mM (1.4 to 2.6 minimum alveolar concentration [MAC]) with the exception of isoflurane (5.3 mM, 6.6 minimum alveolar concentration). Dantrolene (10 μM with 100 nM calmodulin) inhibited ryanodine receptor 2 by 40\% but did not alter the K a for halothane activation. Halothane potentiated luminal and cytoplasmic Ca 2+ activation of ryanodine receptor 2 but had no effect on Mg 2+ inhibition. Halothane activated ryanodine receptor 2 in the absence and presence (2 mM) of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Adenosine, a competitive antagonist to ATP activation of ryanodine receptor 2, did not antagonize halothane activation in the absence of ATP. Conclusions: At clinical concentrations (1 MAC), halothane desflurane and enflurane activated ryanodine receptor 2, whereas isoflurane and sevoflurane were ineffective. Dantrolene inhibition of ryanodine receptor 2 substantially negated the activating effects of anesthetics. Halothane acted independently of the adenine nucleotide-binding site on ryanodine receptor 2. The previously observed adenosine antagonism of halothane activation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ release was due to competition between adenosine and ATP, rather than between halothane and ATP.},

In self-limiting infections such as acute otitis media (AOM) and acute sinusitis, prescribing remains high despite strong guideline recommendations against the routine use of antibiotics. Early career General Practitioners may find evidence-based prescribing challenging. Aim. To establish the prevalence and associations of antibiotic prescribing for AOM and acute sinusitis by Australian vocational trainees in General Practice. Method. A cross-sectional analysis of data from the Registrar Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study. This ongoing, multicentre prospective cohort study documents trainees' consultation-based clinical experiences. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were conducted on data recorded in consultations for AOM or acute sinusitis in nine collection periods during 2010-2014. Results. Data from 856 individual trainees (response rate 95.2\%) were analysed. AOM was managed in 0.9\% of encounters. Antibiotics were prescribed in 78.8\% of cases. Prescribing was significantly associated with longer consultation time and first presentation for this problem. There was no significant association with patient age group. Acute sinusitis was managed in 0.9\% of encounters. Antibiotics were prescribed in 71.2\% of cases. Later-stage trainees and trainees who did not receive their primary medical qualification in Australia were more likely to prescribe an antibiotic for acute sinusitis. Conclusion. Early career GPs are not prescribing in an evidence-based manner. The complexity of guidelines for AOM and acute sinusitis may be confusing for prescribers, especially early career doctors struggling with inexperience and diagnostic uncertainty. Educational interventions are necessary to bring prescribing rates closer to quality benchmarks.},

Methods: Incident cases of AMI identified between 1996 and 2013 from the Hunter New England Health Cardiac and Stroke Outcomes Unit were prospectively collected for this study. We calculated crude and age-adjusted incidence of AMI over an 18-year period and explored differences in remoteness, age, sex and indigenous status. Results: During 1996–2013, a total of 15 480 cases of AMI were identified. There was a significantly higher incidence of AMI in patients from regional areas compared to patients from metropolitan areas. More importantly, while rates of AMI declined by 28\% in metropolitan patients, they increased by 8\% in regional patients. Males had higher rates of AMI throughout the study period than females, however there was trend over time towards a reduction in AMI incidence in males that was not seen in females. The age-adjusted incidence of AMI for indigenous patients increased by 48\% from 2007 to 2013, compared to a 23\% decrease in non-indigenous patients. Conclusion: Between 1996 and 2013 in the Hunter region, the adjusted incidence of AMI increased for regional patients compared to metropolitan patients with a trend towards a higher adjusted incidence of AMI in the indigenous population.},

  abstract = {© 2017 Diabetes UK Aim: There is a high incidence of neonatal hypoglycaemia in neonates born to mothers with pre-existing diabetes. This often necessitates admission to the neonatal intensive care. Guidelines suggest maintaining intrapartum blood glucose levels (BGLs) of 4–7 mmol/l in women with diabetes to reduce the risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia. This study assessed whether intrapartum BGLs in women with pre-gestational Type 1 and 2 diabetes were predictive of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 261 births delivered at a tertiary hospital in Australia from 2009 to 2014. Results: There were 122 cases of neonatal hypoglycaemia (glucose ≤ 2.6 mmol/l) in 261 births (47\%). The mothers in the neonatal hypoglycaemia group spent less time with BGL in the range 4–7 mmol/l [55 ± 37\% vs. 65 ± 35\%, P = 0.02; odds ratio (OR) 0.992, P = 0.03] and more time with BGL in the 7–10 mmol/l range (31 ± 34\% vs. 18 ± 27\%, P = 0.003; OR 1.013, P = 0.003) compared with those without neonatal hypoglycaemia. Although statistically significant, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that time spent with maternal BGLs in the range 4–7 mmol/l [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.58] or 7–10 mmol (AUC = 0.60) was not strong enough to be a useful clinical predictor of neonatal hypoglycaemia. HbA1c in the second trimester of pregnancy (P = 0.02, OR 1.42) and percentage time spent in BGL range of 7–10 mmol/l (P = 0.001, OR 1.02) were both associated with a risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia in a logistic regression model. HbA1c in the third trimester (P = 0.07, OR 1.28) approached, but did not reach, significance. Conclusions: These data support a BGL range of 4–7 mmol/l as an intrapartum target. Glycaemic control in the second trimester is associated with neonatal hypoglycaemia. Improvement in ante- and intrapartum glycaemic control may reduce neonatal hypoglycaemia in women with pre-existing diabetes.},

  abstract = {Background Type 2 diabetes is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Modifiable risk factors have been found to contribute up to 60\% of type 2 diabetes risk. However, type 2 diabetes continues to rise despite implementation of interventions based on traditional risk factors. There is a clear need to identify additional risk factors for chronic disease prevention. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between perceived stress and type 2 diabetes onset, and partition the estimates into direct and indirect effects.   Methods and findings Women born in 1946–1951 (n = 12,844) completed surveys for the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women’s Health in 1998, 2001, 2004, 2007 and 2010. The total causal effect was estimated using logistic regression and marginal structural modelling. Controlled direct effects were estimated through conditioning in the regression model. A graded association was found between perceived stress and all mediators in the multivariate time lag analyses. A significant association was found between hypertension, as well as physical activity and body mass index, and diabetes, but not smoking or diet quality. Moderate/high stress levels were associated with a 2.3-fold increase in the odds of diabetes three years later, for the total estimated effect. Results were only slightly attenuated when the direct and indirect effects of perceived stress on diabetes were partitioned, with the mediators only explaining 10–20\% of the excess variation in diabetes.   Conclusions Perceived stress is a strong risk factor for type 2 diabetes. The majority of the effect estimate of stress on diabetes risk is not mediated by the traditional risk factors of hypertension, physical activity, smoking, diet quality, and body mass index. This gives a new pathway for diabetes prevention trials and clinical practice.},

  abstract = {© 2017 The Royal Society for Public Health Objective Malaysia has a high and rising prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D). While environmental (non-genetic) risk factors for the disease are well established, the role of genetic variations and gene–environment interactions remain understudied in this population. This study aimed to estimate the relative contributions of environmental and genetic risk factors to T2D in Malaysia and also to assess evidence for gene–environment interactions that may explain additional risk variation. Study design This was a case–control study including 1604 Malays, 1654 Chinese and 1728 Indians from the Malaysian Cohort Project. Methods The proportion of T2D risk variance explained by known genetic and environmental factors was assessed by fitting multivariable logistic regression models and evaluating McFadden's pseudo R2 and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). Models with and without the genetic risk score (GRS) were compared using the log likelihood ratio Chi-squared test and AUCs. Multiplicative interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors was assessed via logistic regression within and across ancestral groups. Interactions were assessed for the GRS and its 62 constituent variants. Results The models including environmental risk factors only had pseudo R2 values of 16.5–28.3\% and AUC of 0.75–0.83. Incorporating a genetic score aggregating 62 T2D-associated risk variants significantly increased the model fit (likelihood ratio P-value of 2.50 × 10−4–4.83 × 10−12) and increased the pseudo R2 by about 1–2\% and AUC by 1–3\%. None of the gene–environment interactions reached significance after multiple testing adjustment, either for the GRS or individual variants. For individual variants, 33 out of 310 tested associations showed nominal statistical significance with 0.001 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.05. Conclusion This study suggests that known genetic risk variants contribute a significant but small amount to overall T2D risk variation in Malaysian population groups. If gene–environment interactions involving common genetic variants exist, they are likely of small effect, requiring substantially larger samples for detection.},

  abstract = {© 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Purpose: Survival with advanced pancreatic cancer is less than 12 months. Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency may contribute to pancreatic cancer-related cachexia, via nutrient malabsorption. We aimed to determine the feasibility of prescribing pancreatic extract (Creon®) for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Methods: Patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, without frank malabsorption, were randomised in this feasibility study to pancreatic extract 50,000 units with meals and 25,000 units with snacks, or placebo. Standardised dietary advice was given. Anti-cancer and supportive care treatments were permitted. Outcomes included weight, body mass index (BMI), quality of life (QLQC30, PAN26), survival and nutritional assessment (PG-SGA). Results: Eighteen patients were randomised before study closure due to slow recruitment. Baseline characteristics were well matched. Weight loss prior to randomisation was numerically greater in the pancreatic extract group (mean 0.7 vs 2.2 kg). Weight loss was numerically greater in the placebo group, however not significantly. No differences in BMI or nutrition score were seen. Quality of life did not differ between study groups. Median overall survival was 17 (95\% CI 8.1–48.7) weeks in the control group, and 67.6  (95\% CI 14.1–98.4) weeks in the pancreatic extract group (p = 0.1063). Only 17\% (18/106) of potentially eligible patients were recruited, related to patient/family reluctance, rapid clinical deterioration and patients already prescribed pancreatic extract. A moderate pill burden was noted. Conclusion: Despite intriguing survival results, this study was not sufficiently feasible to proceed to a fully powered comparative study. A multi-centre study would be required to exclude a significant difference in outcomes.},

Methods and design An Aboriginal researcher interviewed women and completed a cross-sectional survey including 20 Likert scales. Setting Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services, community groups and playgroups and Aboriginal Maternity Services in regional New South Wales, Australia. Participants Aboriginal women (n=20) who were pregnant or gave birth in the preceding 18 months; included if they had experiences of smoking or quitting during pregnancy. Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary outcomes: RBD constructs of perceived threat and perceived efficacy, dichotomised into high versus low. Women who had quit smoking, answered retrospectively. Secondary outcome measures: smoking status, intentions to quit smoking (danger control), protection responses (to babies/others) and fear control responses (denial/refutation). Scales were assessed for internal consistency. A chart plotted responses from low to high efficacy and low to high threat. Results RBD Scales had moderate-to-good consistency (0.67-0.89 Cronbach's alpha). Nine women had quit and 11 were smoking; 6 currently pregnant and 14 recently pregnant. Mean efficacy level 3.9 (SD=0.7); mean threat 4.3 (SD=0.7). On inspection, a scatter plot revealed a cluster of 12 women in the high efficacy-high threat quadrant - of these 11 had quit or had a high intention of quitting. Conversely, a group with low threat-low efficacy (5 women) were all smokers and had high fear control responses: of these, 4 had low protection responses. Pregnant women had a non-significant trend for higher threat and lower efficacy, than those previously pregnant. Conclusion Findings were consistent with a previously validated RBD Scale showing Aboriginal smokers with high efficacy-high threat had greater intentions to quit smoking. The RBD Scale could have diagnostic potential to tailor health messages. Longitudinal research required with a larger sample to explore associations with the RBD Scale and quitting.},

To investigate the genetic determinants of variation in grip strength, we perform a large-scale genetic discovery analysis in a combined sample of 195,180 individuals and identify 16 loci associated with grip strength (P{\textless}5 × 10-8) in combined analyses. A number of these loci contain genes implicated in structure and function of skeletal muscle fibres (ACTG1), neuronal maintenance and signal transduction (PEX14, TGFA, SYT1), or monogenic syndromes with involvement of psychomotor impairment (PEX14, LRPPRC and KANSL1). Mendelian randomization analyses are consistent with a causal effect of higher genetically predicted grip strength on lower fracture risk. In conclusion, our findings provide new biological insight into the mechanistic underpinnings of grip strength and the causal role of muscular strength in age-related morbidities and mortality.},

  abstract = {© 2017, Australasian Medical Journal Pty Ltd. All rights reserved. Background Australia has one of the highest rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) in the world. Data from the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP) suggests that only one third of Australians eligible for CRC screening are up-to-date with CRC screening; however screening occurring outside the program is not captured. Aims This study examines the self-reported CRC screening practices of general practice patients, and the factors associated with being under-screened for CRC. Methods A cross-sectional study conducted in five general practice clinics in NSW from 2015-2017. Participants were aged 50-75 and at average risk of CRC. Participants reported whether they had a faecal occult blood test (FOBT) in the past two years, including the source of FOBT; and whether they had a colonoscopy in the past five years and the reason for colonoscopy. Results Forty-nine per cent of participants completed a FOBT in the past two years. Of these, 62 per cent sourced their FOBT from the NBCSP and 25 per cent from their general practitioner. Thirty-seven per cent of participants reported colonoscopy in the past five years. Of these, 29 per cent received potentially inappropriate colonoscopy. Thirty-two per cent of the samples were classified as under-screened. Older adults were less likely to be under-screened. Conclusion CRC screening rates were higher than those reported by the NBCSP, however a significant proportion of participants remain under-screened. Over one-quarter of participants reporting colonoscopy in the past five years may have undergone unnecessary colonoscopy. These findings indicate that more needs to be done at a general practice level to facilitate risk-appropriate CRC screening.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between pain and movement kinematics during functional tasks, evaluated over time, in individuals with chronic idiopathic neck pain.
METHODS: Ten participants with chronic idiopathic neck pain performed 2 functional tasks (overhead reach to the right and putting on a seatbelt) while evaluated using 8 Oqus 300+ cameras. Kinematic variables included joint angles and range of motion (ROM) (°), head segment relative to neck segment (head-neck [HN]); and head/neck segment relative to upper thoracic segment (head/neck-trunk), velocity (m/s), and time (\% of movement phase). Pain was quantified using a 100-mm visual analog scale. Linear mixed effects regression models were used to analyze associations between pain and kinematic variables adjusting for treatment group.
RESULTS: For overhead reach, higher pain was associated with less HN peak rotation at baseline (β = -0.33; 95\% CI -0.52 to -0.14, P = .003) and less HN total rotation ROM at 6 months (β = -0.19; 95\% CI -0.38 to -0.003, P = .048). For the seatbelt task, higher pain was associated with less HN peak rotation (β = -0.52; 95\% CI -0.74 to -0.30 to -0.74, P {\textless} .001) and less HN total rotation ROM at baseline (β = -0.32; 95\% CI -0.53 to -0.10, P = .006). No other movement variables demonstrated meaningful relationships with pain for the reach or seatbelt tasks.
CONCLUSION: Higher pain is associated with less HN peak and total rotation during functional reaching tasks requiring head rotation. Recognizing altered functional kinematics in individuals with chronic neck pain may assist patient management.},

  abstract   = {AIMS: This study aimed to identify behaviours and cues that nurses recognise as indications of unsafe practice, perceived factors that contribute to unsafe practice and actions nurses take in response.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey.
METHODS: National cross-sectional survey of a random sample of Registered Nurses (n = 231) in New Zealand, in 2017-2018. The STROBE Checklist was used to report this study.
RESULTS: Nurses reported a high rate of episodes of unsafe practices and recognised a range of behaviours and cues that alerted them to the potential for unsafe practice. Several organizational issues were perceived to contribute to unsafe practice occurring. The reporting of episodes of unsafe practice and perceived organisational support was low for nurses compared to managers.
CONCLUSION: Failure to recognise and respond to unsafe practice may indicate a tolerance for substandard practice by individual nurses, or by the organisation. Nurses who recognise unsafe practice must be supported by the organisation.
IMPACT: What problem did the study address? This study measured practicing nurses' recognition of, and response to unsafe practice by their peers. What are the main findings? Sixty-six percent of participants reported working with a colleague they felt was practicing unsafely. High workloads, poor teamwork, poor skill mix, and poor organisational culture were identified as contributing to unsafe practice. The reporting rate of unsafe practice was low. Where and on whom will the research have an impact. Creating awareness of the prevalence of unsafe practice informs the profession about the magnitude of the problem and associated issues. Study results can be used by regulatory authorities and health care organisations to develop policies about recognising and responding to unsafe practice. Organisational responses should be non-punitive and should include an investigation and action to prevent further occurrences.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: COVID-19 is complicated by acute lung injury, and death in some individuals. It is caused by SARS-CoV-2 that requires the ACE2 receptor and serine proteases to enter AEC. We determined what factors are associated with ACE2 expression particularly in patients with asthma and COPD.
METHODS: We obtained lower AEC from 145 people from two independent cohorts, aged 2-89 years, Newcastle (n = 115) and Perth (n = 30), Australia. The Newcastle cohort was enriched with people with asthma (n = 37) and COPD (n = 38). Gene expression for ACE2 and other genes potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 cell entry was assessed by qPCR, and protein expression was confirmed with immunohistochemistry on endobronchial biopsies and cultured AEC.
RESULTS: Increased gene expression of ACE2 was associated with older age (P = 0.03) and male sex (P = 0.03), but not with pack-years smoked. When we compared gene expression between adults with asthma, COPD and healthy controls, mean ACE2 expression was lower in asthma patients (P = 0.01). Gene expression of furin, a protease that facilitates viral endocytosis, was also lower in patients with asthma (P = 0.02), while ADAM-17, a disintegrin that cleaves ACE2 from the surface, was increased (P = 0.02). ACE2 protein expression was also reduced in endobronchial biopsies from asthma patients.
CONCLUSION: Increased ACE2 expression occurs in older people and males. Asthma patients have reduced expression. Altered ACE2 expression in the lower airway may be an important factor in virus tropism and may in part explain susceptibility factors and why asthma patients are not over-represented in those with COVID-19 complications.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have high rates of avoidable hospital admissions for chronic conditions, however little is known about the frequency of avoidable admissions for this population. This study examined trends in avoidable admissions among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people with chronic conditions in New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
METHODS: A historical cohort analysis using de-identified linked administrative data of Aboriginal patients and an equal number of randomly sampled non-Aboriginal patients between 2005/06 to 2013/14. Eligible patients were admitted to a NSW public hospital and who had one or more of the following ambulatory care sensitive chronic conditions as a principal diagnosis: diabetic complications, asthma, angina, hypertension, congestive heart failure and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The primary outcomes were the number of avoidable admissions for an individual in each financial year, and whether an individual had three or more admissions compared with one to two avoidable admissions in each financial year. Poisson and logistic regression models and a test for differences in yearly trends were used to assess the frequency of avoidable admissions over time, adjusting for sociodemographic variables and restricted to those aged ≤75 years.
RESULTS: Once eligibility criteria had been applied, there were 27,467 avoidable admissions corresponding to 19,025 patients between 2005/06 to 2013/14 (71.2\% Aboriginal; 28.8\% non-Aboriginal). Aboriginal patients were 15\% more likely than non-Aboriginal patients to have a higher number of avoidable admissions per financial year (IRR = 1.15; 95\% CI: 1.11, 1.20). Aboriginal patients were almost twice as likely as non-Aboriginal patients to experience three or more avoidable admissions per financial year (OR = 1.90; 95\% CI = 1.60, 2.26). There were no significant differences between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in yearly trends for either the number of avoidable admissions, or whether or not an individual experienced three or more avoidable admissions per financial year (p = 0.859; 0.860 respectively).
CONCLUSION: Aboriginal people were significantly more likely to experience frequent avoidable admissions over a nine-year period compared to non-Aboriginal people. These high rates reflect the need for further research into which interventions are able to successfully reduce avoidable admissions among Aboriginal people, and the importance of culturally appropriate community health care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Spirometry is commonly used to assess and monitor lung function. It may also be a useful tool to monitor maternal health during pregnancy. However, large studies examining lung function across gestation are limited. Also, whether spirometry values follow the same pattern during pregnancy in women with and without asthma is unknown.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of advancing gestation, and its interaction with asthma, on lung function in a large well-defined cohort of pregnant women.
METHODS: Data were obtained from prospective cohorts involving women with (n = 770) and without (n = 259) asthma (2004-2017), recruited between 12 and 22 weeks' gestation. Lung function (forced vital capacity [FVC], FEV1, FEV1:FVC\%) was assessed periodically during pregnancy using spirometry. Multilevel mixed-effect regression models were used to assess changes in lung function over gestation.
RESULTS: Asthma had a significant effect on baseline lung function (FEV1\%, -9\%; FVC\%, -3\%; FEV1:FVC\%, -4\%). FVC\% decreased with advancing gestation (-0.07\%/wk; 95\% CI, -0.10 to -0.04]), as did FEV1\%, but only among those without asthma (women without asthma: -0.14\%/wk, 95\% CI, -0.22 to -0.06\%; compared with women with asthma: 0.02\%/wk, 95\% CI, -0.01 to 0.06). FEV1:FVC\% remained relatively stable for women without asthma (0.03\%/wk; 95\% CI, -0.08 to 0.02), but increased for women with asthma (0.06\%/wk; 95\% CI, 0.04 to 0.16).
CONCLUSIONS: Data suggest that advancing gestation negatively affects FVC\% and FEV1\%. This is consistent with extrapulmonary restriction from advancing pregnancy. Yet, the presence of asthma altered the trajectories of FEV1\% and FEV1:FVC\%. Optimal asthma management during pregnancy might have opposed the negative effects of gestation on lung function.},

  abstract   = {OBJECTIVES: Some online, personally tailored, text-based physical activity interventions have proven effective. However, people tend to 'skim' and 'scan' web-based text rather than thoroughly read their contents. In contrast, online videos are more engaging and popular. We examined whether web-based personally tailored physical activity videos were more effective in promoting physical activity than personally tailored text and generic information.
METHODS: 501 adults were randomised into a video-tailored intervention, text-tailored intervention or control. Over a 3-month period, intervention groups received access to eight sessions of web-based personally tailored physical activity advice. Only the delivery method differed between intervention groups: tailored video versus tailored text. The primary outcome was 7-day ActiGraph-GT3X+ measured moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) assessed at 0, 3 and 9 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported MVPA and website engagement. Differences were examined using generalised linear mixed models with intention-to-treat and multiple imputation.
RESULTS: Accelerometer-assessed MVPA increased 23\% in the control (1.23 (1.06, 1.43)), 12\% in the text-tailored (1.12 (0.95, 1.32)) and 28\% in the video-tailored (1.28 (1.06, 1.53)) groups at the 3-month follow-up only, though there were no significant between-group differences. Both text-tailored (1.77 (1.37, 2.28]) and video-tailored (1.37 (1.04, 1.79)) groups significantly increased self-reported MVPA more than the control group at 3 months only, but there were no differences between video-tailored and text-tailored groups. The video-tailored group spent significantly more time on the website compared with text-tailored participants (90 vs 77 min, p=0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The personally tailored videos were not more effective than personally tailored text in increasing MVPA. The findings from this study conflict with pilot study outcomes and previous literature. Process evaluation and mediation analyses will provide further insights.

  abstract = {Nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptors, the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1/TrkA) and the common neurotrophin receptor (NGFR/p75NTR), are increasingly implicated in cancer progression, but their clinicopathological significance in oesophageal cancer is unclear. In this study, the expression of NGF, NTRK1 and NGFR were analysed by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 303 oesophageal cancers versus 137 normal adjacent oesophageal tissues. Immunostaining was digitally quantified and compared to clinicopathological parameters. NGF and NGFR staining were found in epithelial cells and at similar levels between oesophageal cancers and normal oesophageal tissue. NGFR staining was slightly increased with grade (p=0.0389). Interestingly, NTRK1 staining was markedly higher in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OR 2.31, 95\%CI 1.13-4.38, p{\textless}0.0001) and significantly lower in adenocarcinoma (OR 0.50, 95\%CI 0.44-0.63, p{\textless}0.0001) compared to normal oesophageal tissue. In addition, NTRK1 staining was decreased in grade 2 and grade 3 (OR 0.51, 95\%CI 0.21-1.40, p{\textless}0.0001) compared to grade 1, suggesting a preferential involvement of this receptor in the more differentiated forms of oesophageal carcinomas. Together, these data point to NTRK1 as a biomarker and a candidate therapeutic target in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.},

We evaluated the impact of a large-scale regional Aged Care Emergency (ACE) program in reducing hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) transfers.
DESIGN: A stepped wedge nonrandomized cluster trial with 11 steps, implemented from May 2013 to August 2016.
SETTING: A large regional and rural area of northern and western New South Wales, Australia.
PARTICIPANTS: Nine hospital EDs and 81 RACFs participated in the evaluation.
INTERVENTION: The ACE program is an integrated nurse-led intervention underpinned by a community of practice designed to improve the capability of RACFs managing acutely unwell residents. It includes telephone support, evidence-based algorithms, defining goals of care for ED transfer, case management in the ED, and an education program.
MEASUREMENTS: ED transfers and subsequent hospital admissions were collected from administrative data including 13 months baseline and 9 months follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 18,837 eligible ED visits were analyzed. After accounting for clustering by RACFs and adjusting for time of the year as well as RACF characteristics, a statistically significant reduction in hospital admissions (adjusted incident rate ratio = .79; 95\% confidence interval [CI] = .68-.92); P = .0025) was seen (i.e., residents were 21\% less likely to be admitted to the hospital). This was also observed in ED visit rates (adjusted incidence rate ratio = .80; 95\% CI = .69-.92; P = .0023) (i.e., residents were 20\% less likely to be transferred to the ED). Seven-day ED re-presentation fell from 5.7\% to 4.9\%, and 30-day hospital readmissions fell from 12\% to 10\%.
CONCLUSION: The stepped wedge design allowed rigorous evaluation of a real-world large-scale intervention. These results confirm that the ACE program can be scaled up to a large geographic area and can reduce ED visits and hospitalization of older people with complex healthcare needs living in RACFs.},

  abstract   = {INTRODUCTION: Procedural anxiety relates to an affective state of anxiety or fear in relation to a medical procedure. Various treatment-related factors may elicit anxiety among oncology patients, including fear of diagnostic imaging (such as MRI scans) and impending treatment and medical procedures (such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy). It is common in oncology settings to manage acute anxiety relating to medical procedures with anxiolytic medication. However, pharmacological approaches are not suitable for many patients. Despite this, non-pharmacological interventions are infrequently used. The aim of this systematic review is to determine whether non-pharmacological interventions delivered prior to, or during, radiotherapy are effective in reducing procedural anxiety.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Data sources will include the bibliographic databases CINAHL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (from inception onward). Eligible studies will include adult patients with cancer undergoing radiotherapy treatment. Included studies will be those which employ a non-pharmacological intervention, delivered within existing radiotherapy appointments, with the aim of reducing procedural anxiety related to radiotherapy. All research designs with a control or other comparison group will be included. The primary outcome will be change in levels of self-reported procedural anxiety. Secondary outcomes will be changes in scores on physiological measures of anxiety and/or changes in treatment completion and/or changes in treatment duration and/or changes in psychological distress. Two investigators will independently complete title and abstract screening, full-text screening, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality. If appropriate, a meta-analyses will be performed. Any important amendments to this protocol will be updated in the PROSPERO registration and documented in the resulting review publication.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical issues are anticipated from this review. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication and at conferences by presentation.

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Multiple studies have attempted to increase the rate of intravenous thrombolysis for ischemic stroke using interventions to promote adherence to guidelines. Still, many of them did not measure individual-level impact. This study aimed to make a posthoc comparison of the clinical outcomes of patients in the "Thrombolysis ImPlementation in Stroke (TIPS)" study, which aimed to improve rates of intravenous thrombolysis in Australia.
METHODS: A posthoc analysis was conducted using individual-level patient data. Excellent (Three-month post treatment modified Rankin Score 0-2) and poor clinical outcome (Three-month post treatment modified Rankin Score 5-6) and post treatment parenchymal haematoma were the three main outcomes, and a mixed logistic regression model was used to assess the difference between the intervention and control groups.
RESULTS: There was a non-significant higher odds of having an excellent clinical outcome of 57\% (odds ratio: 1.57; 95\% CI: 0.73-3.39) and 33\% (odds ratio: 1.33; 95\% CI: 0.73-2.44) during the active-and post-intervention period respectively, for the intervention compared to the control group. A non-significant lower odds of having a poor clinical outcome was also found in the intervention, relative to control group of 4\% (odds ratio: 0.96; 95\% CI: 0.56-2.07) and higher odds of having poor outcome of 44\% (odds ratio: 1.44 95\% CI: 0.61-3.41) during both active and post-intervention period respectively. Similarly, a non-significant lower odds of parenchymal haematoma was also found for the intervention group during the both active- (odds ratio: 0.53; 95\% CI: 0.21-1.32) and post-intervention period (odds ratio: 0.96; 95\% CI: 0.36-2.52).
CONCLUSION: The TIPS multi-component implementation approach was not effective in reducing the odds of post-treatment severe disability at 90 days, or post-thrombolysis hemorrhage.
